My dear Martha:
I cannot tell you how much I love you. You are twenty-two years old.  I was a poor boy, too, when I loved 
women too young.  But you are beautiful and intelligent, and yet you are not old enough to be lovers.  
Then again, I never liked to be a soldier.
When I wrote to you, I did not expect that over a period of years you would give me the love and confidence 
of a woman. I am sorry to say that on the third day 
after writing I have the strangest dreams….I cannot go to bed, only dreamily. 
Ah! Oh! Oh! Good God! What have I done? What have I said that they should hate me this instant? They do not 
at all, they only laugh at me.  
I am not proud, they say. I am not clever. They tell me to be. They also tell me to be. 
Good God! what have I said that they should love me? They love me for the same reason as they love all the 
young people on this earth – they 
love an chance to be themselves.
My darling girl, you are young enough to love. You can keep to yourself, you know. And yet you also know 
that if you kept to yourself all the 
more you would never love. You have already proved that you can. You have shown that it is possible to 
excel other people. You have shown that success is not everything. 
You have shown that there is more to human nature than sex.
You have shown that men are not born great but strong. 
Good God! what have I done? What have I said that they should fear me, that they should loathe me? They 
do not even loathe me. They only think I




My dearest Lucy,
I have a pretty picture in the best books. I drew it for your honour yesterday. I shall soon send you 
the finished pencil. I am going to England. will you write to me when I reach a big country town
I shall soon have taken a liking to you I am going to London. I shall kiss your hands and feet many a time.
when I get there, I will give you a long talk about my love and wish that you would remain with me
for the rest of our lives I cannot bear the thought of ever leaving you. 
I shall feel sure


I am here to tell you that I love you more than you know.
I love you with an intensity that I can't explain. I just can't explain it. It's like a force within me that is unbreakable to the point of causing my blood to boil.
I am not exaggerating when I say that I feel as though I were about to throw myself headlong from this earth and into the arms of some giant, whose every motion could destroy me or at least slow me down.
But first, I must tell you a little secret, to prove to myself that I am really your lover, not in words, but in feeling.
Because I can no more hide the truth, I am compelled to put on the bravest self-denialism ever attempted by a human being. 
I say "bravely self-denialistic," as in the way in which I boldly proclaim myself to be anything but a simple shopkeeper.
Because, beloved ones, I know that this secret will bring great happiness on your part if, by means of it, you can blind me to the fact that I am just as much a part of you as your wife is to you and your family is to you, and that, although I love you dearly, I love even more deeply the one who loves me.
Because, beloved ones, if I am to live, and love and hold you as my own as one marries and marries a new life, then it is absolutely essential that I should have for a base motive in my life the love of my victim.
And so I have come up with the wildest idea—the most outrageous one, in fact—that you, my love, are secretly plotting against me.
You know, I was just coming out of the office, my window peering over your hedge, when you turned round and said—
"Why, there! Just outside! Just outside! It's you! It's you!"
"Oh, yes," I laughed, "I saw you there the other day."
That is all true—except that after I had gone, I saw you coming, and, swiping your fly with the tip of my pen, I caught the word "pen" there, too.
That is all true, too, though it is more or less trite—that sort of true—and that sort of trifling true which you tell your

My Dearest: I have not been able to sleep very well this morning, as if I had been up all night. I up and down and called at all the house bells; but my mother never enters or leaves the room, except in the morning when I kiss her hands a thousand times before.
Last night I dreamed I saw you yesterday. . . . I dreamed you were brushing your hair as you went to bed. . . . I dreamt you were talking to yourself as you fell asleep. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your coffee. . . . I dreamt you were brushing your teeth as you were lying down. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were drawing. . . . I dreamt you were putting on your shoes as you went to bed. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your breakfast as you were going to bed. . . . I dreamt you were finishing your afternoon nap as you were going to bed.
This morning I dreamt you were finishing dinner as you were going to bed. . . . I dreamt you were finishing your night nap as you were going to bed.
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your breakfast as you were going to bed. . . . I dreamt you were finishing your afternoon nap as you were going to bed.
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your dinner as you were going to bed. . .
