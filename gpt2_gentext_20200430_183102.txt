In a statement, the EC said it was "appalled" by the "despicable" attack and that it would be pursuing all the legal means at its disposal.
Christophe Deloire, the president of Renault, said: "This is a very, very horrible and sickening attack.
"We are our own judge, not only of ourselves, but also of the person we are. This is why, as a firm friend of mine, I am shocked and astonished by this act.
"I hope that this is not the end of the matter, that someone will come forward with a better judgment.
"Perhaps in five, ten years time, we will have a law whereby a person's capability to drive a car is a matter of value - a future society will recognize the value of talent."
Anne-Marie Oliva, the president of Astra, said: "I am shocked and shocked. This is unbearable. This is terrorism.
"This is not the way our society should be. This is not the way we want to live with each other.
"We will not allow it. We will not allow it up to a point. We must not let up. There is no other way to put this.
"There is another way and that is through a dialogue, through a discussion, through a process."
Marianne Vos, the president of Daimler, said: "I am deeply shocked and shocked by the despicable act that has been committed.
"I have just been in touch with the prosecutor, who is conducting an investigation. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are carrying out an internal investigation."
In a statement, the EC said: "Today the EC had a telephone conversation with Volkswagen AG concerning the promotion of a more environmentally friendly approach in the car industry.
"At the request of Volkswagen AG, the EC has initiated a formal investigation into the matter.
"In the meantime, the promotion of a more environmentally friendly approach is considered essential for the implementation of this initiative.
"If information concerning the internal investigation leads to a more serious breach of the law, however, the Commission may decide to take legal action.
"We have the mandate to carry out an internal investigation, which is what we are doing.
"We will carry out our mandate, as long as there is no further evidence to suggest that there has been no breach of law.

Detroit — A federal judge has ordered a stop to a police practice of putting unarmed protesters in chokeholds, saying the practice places officers' lives in danger and is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge James C. Robart in San Francisco on Monday signed off on a request from the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it would seek an injunction that would prevent the practice.

Robart's order came 15 days after a jury in Ferguson, Mo., ruled Darren Wilson, a white police officer, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Oakland on July 27 by the Brown family and other plaintiffs alleged that the stop in Ferguson was an abridgment of the use of force and that other police tactics, such as a policy of using body cameras, are constitutional.

The use of force is defined as "the use of physical force — physical force such as, but not limited to, arrest, detention, verbal abuse, and, in extreme circumstances, deadly force — against an individual because of his or her race, color, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution."

The lawsuit cited a New York circuit court ruling in which a jury found that officers had used chokeholds on a black driver who refused to stop and was neck-deep in the path of a police truck.

The next day, an ACLU lawsuit said, an officer using a chokehold on a black man in a police car in New York had struck the man in his patrol car as he attempted to escape.

And a lawsuit filed in April

====================
A Bosnian man has been accused of killing his disabled sister by stabbing her 53 times in an apparent hate crime.

Kersti Jovanovic was just 17 months old when her life was cut short by a car crash in September 1993.

Her twin sister, now aged nine, suffered more than 60 per cent of Kersti's body parts.

Kersti had been taking prescription painkillers and keeping to herself, and her mother, Janina, was devastated when she learned of her daughter's death.

Janina said: 'She had no idea. She couldn't believe it. She said: "Do you think she's dead?" and I said: "No, I don't think so".'

Kersti was a bubbly, healthy, happy little girl who loved to read and was a dedicated family reader. Her mother even made Kersti a copy of the Christmas Christmas book, which she passed around the house.

On the night of her death, Kersti's twin sister, Anna, was said to have become 'just like Kersti'.


Kersti suffered horrific injuries to her face, arms and back. Her sister was never the same after she had been slashed so many times.

Her parents, Stefan and Janina, have a three-year-old son, Martin, who they want to raise with the utmost care.


They went to the police after hearing about the reports. Mr Stefan, 44, said: 'We didn't want to believe it, but they told us she had been stabbed.

'She was such a lovely little girl. She loved to read and was a great reader. We were devastated. We thought she had died.

'We are both in our forties but we know what kind of a mother lets her children go off at an early age. We always wanted to be police.

'Martin always said: "My sister, my sister."'


Janina, a single mother of two, said: 'I was totally shocked. My first thought was to go to the hospital.

'I called a few people and everyone said to me to keep calm.

'I thought: "She must have fallen asleep".'


Martin, who has Asperger's syndrome, is now seven.

He said: 'I've seen some

There are so many good things about this book. I enjoyed it immensely.

In an interview with the Guardian, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the main armed wing of the dominant Sunni Muslim denomination in the region, said the crisis in the region was a direct result of the policies of Baghdad.

It comes amid allegations by Prime Minister Maliki of being to blame for the unrest that has engulfed parts of the country in recent weeks.

The PM, whose party won a landslide victory in the elections, has blamed "terrorists" for instigating the unrest, while the country's Shia majority has accused the Sunni prime minister of being responsible for the deaths of at least 170 people.

On Wednesday, Mariam al-Douri, the wife of an army officer, was among the nearly 900 people who were killed at the hands of angry mobs this month.

Greg Abbott on Saturday signed legislation that would allow faith-based organizations to deny services to same-sex couples, a move that was met with mixed reactions from the gay rights community and from many in his own party.

The measure, known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, allows for discrimination based on the owners' religious beliefs, and it went into effect on Dec. 6.

The legislation has divided the Republican Party, with many in the party — including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the party's presidential candidate — supporting the measure and others, such as Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, saying they would not support Mr. Abbott for president in 2016.<|endoftext|>I put together this cube a while back but haven't gotten around to posting it.

For all the talk of the Falcons and offense, the team that's supposed to run the football probably can't score.
It has been a long season for the Falcons, and for Robert Griffin III, who was supposed to be the franchise quarterback.
Last week, the coach said Griffin would get there.
Then, in a radio interview, Falcons coach Dan Quinn said the defense couldn't get there.
Well, we thought we'd find out.
So, on Monday, we went up to the complex, what you'd call, you know, a high school level football.
We wanted to see Griffin play. And the fact is, we wanted to see him score more touchdowns.
We thought, he's got it in him. He's got it.
He's the quarterback of the greatest football team the game has ever seen.
We thought, we've got it too.
We said, Robert, you're the quarterback of the Super Bowl champions, and they said, let's see if we can getcha.
We said, we won't. We said, we're not the champion, we're the media. We said, we can't do it.
They said, we can if you'll just concentrate. We said, we'll just concentrate.
And now, a few days later, we're telling you all about it.
We thought, we can't have a failed experiment like Robert Griffin III, who's supposed to be this great, genius,
who's supposed to change the game every single time he steps on the field.
So we said, we'll just give him a little rest, a little diet, a little rest. And now, as you can see, it's working.
He's scoring touchdowns at an unbelievable rate. He's putting up some unbelievable numbers.
We think he might even be our best football player. And we can't wait to get back out there and put it all on the line.
I mean, we're playing a team that's never lost a game. We've got to do whatever we can to win.
And we can't have the media and everybody else saying anything bad about the way we're playing, because they do think we're not
playing at the elite level that we should be.
We're not. We're just playing at an elite level. And we think we might be the best team in the history of the game

The city of New York has a rich history of public works and improvements, and this is only the first step on that journey. But I am confident that in time, when the current of progress has worn away all the physical and mental resistance, we will reach a stage in which new forms of art will assume a new importance and a new generation of New Yorkers will rise to become the envy of the world.
In the meantime, I want to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to all the riders, for both the driver and for the group of passengers who have been so kind as to make reservations for us. This group of people, who have proven so willing to travel long distances for little or no return, have been my true heroes.

The first seven rounds are dominated by teams that have no shot at taking a player, and teams that are trying to move up to the upcoming round have taken one player before we even get there.

The elite skaters in this draft? None.

The injured? None.

The bottom third of picks? None.

That's the league we're in.

We're not in the Stanley Cup Playoffs yet, so there's that.

But the picks that have been taken? Right now, we have a minnow on our hands.

Well, there you have it.

There are only two things that will make you unhappy. The first one is news of the death of your beloved wife. The other one is the discovery of a million rubles worth of stolen jewelry.

This is the most unbelievable experience of my life.

This was the opening email we got from Lisa, the new chef at the restaurant. She was very sweet and welcoming and we are so glad we took the job. Her first few days were a complete bust — we were being rude, she was being very helpful and kind, and then, one day, she came into Lisa's office and said, "This is it — we are the best team in the country!"

We have already started working on the opening menu and, if all goes as planned, we will have presented it to the entire staff by Easter.

We are so looking forward to our next job — we know we will not work here and our days will be very dull — but we will not give up hope if you say no.

We cannot tell you about our new digs — we cannot tell you how much we love you — and we cannot tell you how much we love your family, but we Can tell you one thing for sure, it is going to be the best job in the world.

We cannot express how much our lives have already changed. We will not go into details — you can imagine — and we will not write blogs or anything crazy like that — we just want to tell you how much we love and miss you.

We will see you tomorrow,

I went to bed yesterday, after having been up all night and through the day in a state of excitement. . . . I am not a woman able to rest quietly, and, therefore, after having had a large drink of brandy and having read a great deal, I am now up to disorder. . . . I will not lie and say that we are not in a state to contend for the world.
What have we got? Nothing. We have no idea of a war; we have nothing to call for sacrifice; we have nothing to teach the world, nothing to convince men that they are victims, nothing to make them think twice before they do injustice. All our hopes are shattered upon this blank sheet before our eyes. . . .
I had rather die in this unhappy position than give the idea of a happy future a semblance of a shape or a name. I am dying to die, and I would much rather die a thousand deaths happier than live a thousand more.
My Dearest: I have not been able to sleep very well this morning, as if I had been up all night. I up and down and called at all the house bells; but my mother never enters or leaves the room, except in the morning when I kiss her hands a thousand times before.
Last night I dreamed I saw you yesterday. . . . I dreamed you were brushing your hair as you went to bed. . . . I dreamt you were talking to yourself as you fell asleep. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your coffee. . . . I dreamt you were brushing your teeth as you were lying down. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were drawing. . . . I dreamt you were putting on your shoes as you went to bed. . . .
This morning I dreamt you were finishing your breakfast as you were going to bed. . . . I dreamt you were finishing your afternoon nap as you were going to bed.
This morning I dreamt you were finishing dinner as you were going to bed. . . . I dreamt you were finishing your night nap as you were going to bed.

====================
Curiously, the problem of the evils of pollution in their day seems to have passed them by, and the consciousness of its evils has increased their love of health. They have learned to walk about in the dark and have lost all fear of death. They have become filled with a calm confidence that death is but the beginning of sorrows and that happiness is but the movement of the day. They have become contented with a few small objects in the life of the world and have neglected the great and the complex — the Universe and all that is within it.
In the midst of all their happiness they have lost a certain dread of death, and this dread they retain even in their dreams. They have the habit of referring to certain persons, events, or objects the name of their dead loved one, without any apparent satisfaction; they are as certain of its existence as if they had actually seen it. They often repeat the name in their waking hours, without so much as pausing to chew their words.
In a word, they have lost the faculty of horror — of dread — of the painful sense of what is dear to our nature and heart, and yet so foreign that we cannot endure it.
In a word, they have lost the faculty of love, and the habitual feeling that we must never miss out upon the temporal blessings of this world.
In a word, they have lost their first love, their chief delight, the surest refuge of their souls, the surest comfort of their sorrows, the surest repose of their hopes, the surest support of their prejudices, and the surest stage on which to appear before the tribunal of time.
In a word, they have all gone astray from themselves and all that is noble, modest, and beautiful.
They have lost all restraint and swerved almost to anarchy; they have burst forth in wild and uncontrollable passion, have trampled everything under foot, have trampled their new faith down with them, and are now preparing, by every possible means, to inflict their cruel vengeance.
They have no restraint, no regulation, no restraint; they have no bounden duty; they have no scruple whatever about anything; they are reckless and brutal, cruel and brutal; they have no restraint whatever; they are almost maniacal in their cruelties; they are almost mad in the sufferings they inflict; they are approaching with eagerness with every available opportunity to inflict even greater

If you're like most people, you've been trying to optimize your online presence for growth.

Good news, there's a simple, effective, and inexpensive way to do that that only takes a few minutes a day.

This post will tell you how to create an email marketing list that's both organic and click-worthy, as well as show you how to capture the attention of the very people you're trying to convert.

And if you're like most people… you're probably thinking, "But what if I can't remember to reply to my list?"

Good.

First of all, it's important to understand what your target audience is.

If you read a lot of the email marketing copy out there, you'll probably be surprised at how few people are actually in your email marketing list.

They're mostly there to get in your door. They're your family and friends.

That's it.

But if you read a lot of the copy that people send you, it may strike you as odd that so few are actually in your list.

You may even start to wonder if they're just there to give you their number… or to ask you to do something.

In truth, most people in your email list aren't you.

They're actually hundreds, even thousands of people around the world.

And every day they reach out to you, whether it's through your email, Facebook, Twitter, blogs or any other medium, they're telling you about amazing new people and amazing new experiences they've had with them.

And every time you click on their link, they could be helping you to change your life.

Your email list isn't some random collection of random people.

The following is sourced from a speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968.
I would like to begin by thanking all the people of this great land of ours, and especially my wife, Mrs. Martin Luther King, for all the support and affection they have given me.
I cannot express the amount of pleasure and satisfaction that I feel in this beautiful land where freedom of thought, association, worship and commerce are cherished as cherished as in the Colonies.
I have often thought that this is the land of the free, and of the people, — that is to say, of tyrants and the people only.
It is the land of the brave, and it is the land of the free.
I will never forget one evening in 1869, as I rode along, in the shadow of the great oak, I seemed to be listening to the distant howl of millions of chained hearts, but on the other hand I could make out only the low, mournful murmur of my own heart.
In that evening I knew — I knew — I knew — I was free.
In that evening, on that fateful evening, I swore an oath — an oath I can still feel an binding one.
I swore an oath that I would one day see my children one last time.
I swore an oath that I would one day work in the great Union treasury, and one day one thousand hands on the wheel of social progress.
That oath I kept, and I keep it fast.
In that evening, on that fateful evening, I swore an oath that I would one day see my children become real human beings.
In that evening I vowed an oath that I would one day treat my slaves fairly, with respect, and with humanity.
In that evening, on that fateful evening, I vowed an oath that I would one day see my slaves not only live up to their sacred names — but that I would one day make their memory a sacred page in the great unfinished book of human rights.
That is the dream I had, and that is the dream I still have, my dear girl.
In that evening, on that fateful evening, I swore an oath that I would one day see my children hold their own against the mighty might of human enterprise.
In that evening, on that fateful evening, I vowed an oath that I would one day see my children set an example both to all

AMY GOODMAN: In May, the New York Times published a story that details how Justice Clarence Thomas was caught on video berating a trans student while the two were in the women's bathroom at Princeton. Thomas, it is reported, began by telling the transgender student, "I don't want to talk to you about any of that. I just want to get out of here now and get this over with." The student reportedly replied, "I'm not leaving until you tell me to."

Justice Clarence Thomas lectures at the University of Texas at Austin on April 1, 2003.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CLIFFORD THOMAS: Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be here, and I would like to say a few words. I think in all this, I think in all that I have heard and done, I have failed to do justice to the great body of humanity who feel, as I do, as little — as little as they can possibly feel — about the great social problem of this day and age.

I want to ask you a question which I hope will not seem strange to you, but which, if it does, it is not at all: Have you ever considered, since the day you were born, whether you, too, might one day grow up to be as great and famous as some of your great-great-grandparents, or as little as some of your less-loved-and-feared can become?

I know that in many ways this is a very personal question for me, and I am not the sort of person who would wish to be understood, even by my own children and grandchildren, so very nearly as to infer some personal background about me.

But I would like to know your answer to it. Have you, as your only guide and guide in this dark and difficult matter, supposed to your writing, some vague and imperfect notion of what it is to really feel, as you yourself so skillfully and deliberately have so skillfully and precisely described yourself — to truly be, truly be, as you so skillfully and precisely and so skillfully and precisely are?

I am sure you have not—you have no conception of the terrors, the disappointments, and even the hopeless inadequacies of the idea.

I have never been fond of children. They always seem to me to be playing at cards or jesting. Neither wise nor innocent I could be. I would have none of their foolish games, their childish advan- tages, their cruel triumphs. Theirs is the deepest regret that I have ever known that I should have borne a child. It is a sorrow that has troubled me ever since I knew my husband. I could not bear it, I could not look upon it, I could not take part in it. I felt I owed it all to some wiser counsellor, some higher power. I beseech you, my dear Deified One, by all the might of my life, by the faith that I profess, by the Giver of all things, to show me in you a husband, a father, a friend, a true friend, one who loves faithfully and equitably, one who cherishes with all his heart and with all his soul the best of all parents, the Prince Charles of Sweden. My dearest Kate, thither goes my beloved Charles, with all the most faithful attendants. Among them there is one companion who is a learned man, one named Willem de Kock. Will you kindly confer some special favour upon him, as our popes have conferred on such illustrious persons as Caesars, Caesars, and we beseech you to send him one thousand thanks for his faithful attendance in all our presence. — Henry VIII, 1461.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is one of the most powerful and important public agencies in our nation's capital, but it is also one of the least understood. It is my hope that my talk today, and the talk of those to come, will make a great difference.
It is a sad fact of life that the more we are understood, the less we are cared for. The people are wise enough to know that the more they are valued, the less they are cared for.
Aristotle said, "The wise man does not seek fame, but unachievable things; fame seeks him which is knoweth no man, and which God doth not choose, neither doth man."
And in the same wise, it is certain that the wise man will not seek to be understood, but to be loved. It is a matter of practice for the wise man to seek out those who he can be loved by, and to give them his affectionate ear.
I have been privileged to knowledg with a great many men, women, and even of my own race, such things as they are and can be like me, and to know their hearts and souls and aspirations in the same breath.
I have seen their souls multiply and surpass their wildest imaginings, and I have known their souls swell with a love that is their own and which they themselves can neither conquer nor die for.
I have felt their souls swell with a love that is deathless, and that is deathless I can never again describe to her.
I have studied their hearts and souls, and learned their secrets in the meanwhile; and though I should be able to testify to their souls and to speak their language, yet, as it is, I cannot possibly to do either thing, and the same is so also to be said of hers.
We shall meet again, perhaps in another world, and, though we shall not know each other, we shall still love one another, and this shall be because we have in our souls as much love as theirs does, and because our souls are that which they can have.
I will not dwell too long upon this subject, on account of the great number of people in the audience, and also of the fact that the discourse for which I stand here today are but the commencement of a series.
It may be thought unworthy of me the space herein allotted to speak of you, that I should

I can't wait to show you all what I've been cooking up this week!
All of my readers are precious to me. I read every comment, and I respond to every one.
I love you guys so much. I feel like I have you all in my life. I love you.
I love you.
~ Courtney
I received my box today and it is AMAZING!
First off, thank you so much so much so much for your kind words. They make my day out of day! You are truly everything I've ever wanted to be and more. I can't express how much I love everything you have ever made and shared with me.
My Santa also sent me a Harry Potter t-shirt, a Harry Potter scarf, a Harry Potter book, a Harry Potter art pencil, a Harry Potter poster and a Harry Potter camera. I have been wanting to get into the Harry Potter series ever since I heard about the Cursed Child
====================
I didn't want to be like her. I didn't want to take control of my fate.
I was convinced that the only way out was to marry her. And so I did.
And I love her. I miss her so.
I miss you so.
I'm sorry. You are.
I thought maybe I might get over it. Maybe one day I'd wake up one day and be like,
and you'd just be like,
You know, I love you.
And one day I'll be like that is…
And one day will be like it is. One day.
And then it won't be a cold, hard, iron-clad verdict. It'll just be…
Oh, God.
It's just… it's been such an amazing, wonderful ride.
I've just finished a novel, by the way.
I loved the first one.
That's it. No more. Not another one.
It took me a while to get used to the idea that maybe I shouldn't be doing this.
That maybe I wasn't capable of doing something as hard, as much as I'd like to.
That maybe I wasn't good enough.
That maybe I wasn't human enough.
But then I realized that it isn't about me. It's not about my problems.
It's not about my flaws. It's not even about the fact that I'm a woman.
I don't need a man to see that I've got them. All I need is the sunshine.
All I need is to let myself be led by the breeze of life…
…to the secret heart of my being…
…to the secret place where all that is wonderful and pure and pure in the whole vastness of creation is waiting to be stirred…
…to lead the lonely traveler on his way…
…to the secret door to the vast interior of being…
…to the place where all that is beautiful and pure and pure in the universe is waiting to be stirred…
…to lead the lonely traveler on his way…
…to the secret heart of every being…
…to the secret door to the infinite interior of being.

mystique

The power of the romantic imagination is that which the ear, when it is listened to, and the heart which beholds it, instinctively and with a fixed purpose, deduces.

Romance, it is said, is a flight of fancy, a quieting of the storm — a steady march of reason, conscience, reason, towards the sweetest sources.

I will not deny that the wind has been astride my romance; but it is reason, not romance, that has died and sunk beneath its weight.

Reason has not the power to fly, it is immovable; it cannot be moved; it is not above being dominated; it is not frivolous; it is not proud; it is not indolent; it is not careless of one's necessities; it is patient; it is punctilious; it is submissive; it is patient, submissive, and submissive to necessity; it is patient, submissive, and submissive to necessity; it is patient, submissive, and submissive to necessity; it is patient, submissive, and submissive to necessity; it is patient, submissive, and submissive to necessity;

to sacrifice our lives for it.

My soul longs to die for you; yet my life would be a trifling sacrifice were it not compared with that which it could take if it chose.

If the soul of a true lover longs to die for its beloved one, how much more for itself, and more ardently than love itself demands!


To-night I close my heart to you, my only beloved, with the most ardent kisses.


To-day I close my door behind me, leaving you to meditate on your happiness, and leaving behind me a lingering regret that my labors should not have been in vain.


I have made myself presentable to every natural impulse, and am deeply moved by every emotion. I thank the gods that I love you, that I still have a being and passions worthy of you, and that I still retain the faculty of feeling — that I may again be united to you, and to you to me, an immortal being and a vital passion.

I thank the gods that you approved of every design which I was then pursuing, and that you sanctioned every resolution which I now pursue.

I thank the gods that, though the storm has passed

There are many ways to do this, such as by changing the exposure, blending, sharpening, cropping, and so on. However, for this tutorial we are going to use the color wheel.
The color wheel is a great tool to get a better idea of how a photo looks like. To use the color wheel, simply tilt your device to the left or right.
Once you tilt your device to the right or left, a small circle with the color of the photo should appear on the screen.
If the circle is bigger or smaller, the color of the photo will be more or less different.
When you tilt your device to the left or right, the circle should look like this
The bigger or smaller the circle, the brighter or darker the photo.
When you tilt your device to the left or right, the circle should look like this

To the Editor:

Re "The Case for Mutual Aid" (The Scotsman, Feb. 17), by F. A. Hayek, is an excellent work. But it is also a moral one. It is also a matter of great practical importance. Neither the purely practical nor the merely the sentimental can possibly occupy the whole attention of a man of action.

The latter is the first to be swept away, the former to be developed.

Let us attempt to do both in the same line. Our task is to organize the existing economic machinery into a rational whole with a definite end; this is a great and noble ideal. But our task is to organize it in such a way as to render it practically possible; this last is a very small step.

We may safely conclude from this that we have failed in our object; that we have not succeeded in tending the economic forces that are already shaping our lives.

We may not, of course, decide at once to try to transform economic life in such a way as to render it rational; on the contrary, we may, on the contrary, have a hard time admitting that we have even tried to transform it at all. But we may at least admit that we have tried hard and that we have not succeeded; and this is a great step in the direction in which we must and will go.

Your kind letter, written on the occasion of 83 years of friendship, brings home to me once more the deep and abiding earnestness with which I embrace you.

With the deepest respect,
F.V.K.

The following is a transcription of a speech given by President Woodrow Wilson to a meeting of the Michigan Democratic Central Committee on January 12, 1917.


I have had the honor to knowledgHT the people of the United States. I have seen the face and manners of their kings and queens. I have thrIVKd their pride and joy. I have heard their prayers and entreaties. I have been thRIIVKING my whole life since I knew the earth, and the next as long as I can remember will be as I KNEW. And I have thrIVKD this country to be the best, faireST, and hOVKINGEST it can possibly be. I have seen the day is near, when all nations shall hail and leave their foul waste to dwell in its bosom; when all shall say, "HEIL, HEIL, KING, Lord our God, we have met in the arena, crowned his precious shield, crowned our heads with thralds, crowned our hearts with rays of glory!"


My fellow Americans! I am John D. Rockefeller. I am 71 years old. I am one of the 514,834,100 men and women on this earth, of all the men, women, and children, who have ever lived, or ever may live on this earth, or ever shall live in this world. I am the son of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Isabella Rockefeller, and the daughter of Theodore and Clara Loomis.


My grand-father, Nelson, came from Connecticut to live with his family in a little settlement called Greenwich, where he remained one fine year. We are called the Lost Generation for not having heard of it. Were it not for the labors of our great-Grandparents, we should be called the First People. The time has come for all Americans to become our Ancestors. The time has come for Americans to become our Grandchildren.


I have a dream that one of our families will one day reside in a great city on the shores of a great river. I have a dream that their faith, their success, and their love will be the thread that unites this great and free world.


I have a dream that in returning home each summer my three young daughters will one day meet their father in a park or on the beach. They will not know magic or tragedy. They will know me and my family.

Full text of "The Merry Wives of Holi"

The Merry Wives of Holi BOMB At all events you have been a good deal interested in my works, because you read them with interest and pleasure. One of the things which interests me deeply is your artistic sensitiveness. I feel that in everything I have tried I have failed to develop the human spirit in the highest degree. I have tried to dominate you in everything. For example, I have tried to take from you for my own that which you gave me, and I have wanted nothing more than to give you everything. I have tried to make you my friend only in so far as you have so charitably treated me. And I have tried to make you hate me only in so far as you have so lovingly loved me. Do you know how often I have said to myself, "If only you loved me, you would hate me," and how heartlessly I have answered you, "I love you." Similarly have I tried to mould you only in so far as you have so unselfishly behaved. The same is true of you; you are only human when it comes to human instincts. The same is also true of me. I have tried to mould you only in so far as you have so so unselfishly treated me. The same is also true of you. Love is blind, sensuality furious, passion indolent. When you are foolish and passionate, Love is sweet, but when you are wise and passionate, Love is resolute. When you are foolish and passionless, Love is cruel and haughty, when you are wise and passionless, Love is love-affectionate and loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness loving-kindness Loving-kindness.

The National Security Agency is collecting $1 billion worth of internet data a month from Verizon customers, according to documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden.

The Guardian reported yesterday that the NSA is collecting 2.8 terabits per second of data a day in the US, including the browsing history of online shoppers. That would take 28 years to collect in Canada.

The number of internet users in the US has risen from about 645m in February 2007 to more than 730m in February 2011.

The Guardian wrote that the data is being "analyzed and shared with corporate America" and that it was the largest-ever collection of customer information by the US government.

The documents it has obtained show that the NSA has shared the information with private security companies, including private security firms based in Canada.

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the country's largest counter-terrorism agency, is also the owner and operator of two of the largest internet surveillance centres in the country: one in Ottawa, the other in Milton, Ont.

They have been operating in compliance with the law since 2010. The NSA oversight body, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, has the power to order the blocking of the Internet links of suspected terrorists or other threats.

The NSA said it did not comment on intelligence matters.

On Friday, the Foreign Affairs minister, Stéphane Dion, said that the US had not updated its information-gathering convention since the 1960s. "The fact that the US does not update the convention does not mean that the law has not changed."

The commissioner of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Mr Justice Peter G Inglis, said that while it was not his role to involve the executive in domestic law enforcement, "I do think that we would have a responsibility to update the law where we find gaps".<|endoftext|>Poverty

Don't get me wrong, this is an area where we can all agree on a lot of things. The fact that some of us can't can't be blamed on us. We all feel that way sometimes. But it's also important to realize that people with less means have a hard time living in this world.

It's like this. If you have a horse and you could afford to buy a new one, you'd go out and buy a new horse every year. But if you can't afford to buy a new one, what are you going to

There are many lies told about me, but one that unites them all is this: that I am a simple creature, contented with what I have, contented with my lot, contented with my lot alone. Such is the story; such is its ring of truth.
But there is another, which, however it may have its day, yet has not been told. It is told chiefly by those who love you, and especially by those who have been most of all a few peepings in your life.
One glance into your beautiful little eyes, and I would ask you a favour beyond anything you could have asked.
I would ask you to do me a great kindness, that is, to devote your whole heart and strength to my service, and to lose all thought of yourself. Think of me, you splendid being, thinking being, which God has designated as the palace for the Divine.
I am only a servant, and God has not appointed a King or any one to rule over a Kingdom. But I would ask you to think of me as your sole care, and to love me as you love the baize flies or the pigeons.
You are to me as the baize is to the dove, or as the golden powder puff is to the flower. The first object is to excite in the creature an appetite that its mate cannot satisfy, and to this end it provokes in the creature a corresponding attachment.
The second object is to enliven the once lifeless being, to dress it with life, to recall it from the dead memory, to clothe it with life, to clothe it with the fragrance of life.
Think of me, and my prayer will be done.


I have been a stranger in your house, 
a hearthstone from which no light comes, a shrine 
filled with dark shadows, a city without life and mystery, where death and confusion rule like a soft breeze and life like a summer day.
Do you not know that most of my friends- men, on whom your sitter depends for happiness-are living far from your house?
If you only knew.
My driveway is very dark. The light I give into your room is only dimmer and dimmer,   so that sometimes it seems to be blocked up.
I've got a dead light bulb in the parlour. I turned it on for an hour this morning and

====================
The novel, the play, the music, the films, I've loved them all, and I'll always love 'em all.
— Henry James


Life is too short to have too many of these delightful short idylls, where you are so easily taken by surprise, where you think I don't notice 'em, when I do, I say—
—Oh, it's all over—it's all over!—
There's nothing to be found in all these idyllic reveries but cold, hard science. It is all in the balance—and it is to be
a thousand to one to none!


I've said it before and I'll say it again—I believe that no one man shall own more of the earth than another. It is a truth—and it is a most wonderful truth—that we shall never exist peopled by powerful, intelligent, conscious beings unless both of us work incredibly hard, strive so intently to realize the fullness of the human experience in our respective bodies and minds, and to extend that experience to others—to others to generations yet unborn—to others as we have so far conceived and so far psiciled 'til death in them.


Whilst I write this line, however, I feel a warm, fuzzy, almost irresistible desire to tell you that I already am (if my journal is to be believed)—that this is but the beginning of a glorious series of dearly-beloved exchanges which I shall happily pass through in my lifetime–to which I can only refer with rapture–and from which you will probably never awake–as I have only recently been snoring–

Foreword by Charles Baudelaire.


The day has come when, in order to render due homage to the departed, and to render due acknowledgment of my profound respect and affection for his body and soul, and in order to offer myself in his place a personal amends for all that has been done me, and which I sincerely hope will be of some use in the future–I–[a-noke]]–a name which, however, I shall have to protect with all the greater vigilance–[eep]]–[etah].

There have been many bands that have fallen away, some more than others, some by death, and some by other ways. But the one band that has not yet fallen is God Save the King. My God! Has it not been long since I first heard its notes, and I have longed to dance to them?
The first time I heard them I was very young, and was very much taken with their harpsichord playing. I have since been a very old man, and have not been able to put them down to any longer like instruments.
I am sorry to say that I shall soon leave my boyhood friends, and live in the company of men much older than myself.
I have known many a bandit, and once, while I was with them, I caught a glimpse of their golden chariot.
I never forget one day sitting by myself in my room, looking out my window, when out of the corner of my eye I beheld a red-haired woman walking leisurely along the lawn. I said to myself, "That is the pretty Lola of Lombardy!"
Then, in another instant, standing by myself, I likewise caught a glimpse of her red carriage. I will never forget the third beauteous vision that I witnessed that day.
In it I saw herself, too, sitting in the best of style, in a fine velvet satin dress, with a gold fringe about her neck and hair down her back swept back in a high voluptuous bun.
She had on a silken waistcoat with gold trim, and a silky white train about her neck.
Out of the same loveliness appeared, out of the same immaculate dress, a lovelier form.
Out of the same loveliness shimmered out, out of the same pure white immaculate camellia sprang up.
Out of the same loveliness were we-
Out of the same pure white shimmered were we
Out of the same loveliness were we
Out of the same loveliness were we
Out of the same pure white shimmered were we
Out of the same loveliness were we
Then, too, when I had seen angels with my Divine eyes, I said to myself, "There she is, there she is! There she is!"
Then came to my remembrance certain women that I had known to be beautiful
====================
There have been a few sources of amusement in my life. One is found in the lively exchanges that take place at Exeter College, where we once had a lecture on the history of thought and of morality. In the course of it, I asked a student if she thought that the consequentialist theory of morality was true. She replied that it was not only true, but that it was the only theory which she knew. I said that was a curious theory in one respect: that is, that it was the only theory in which one could have any comfort, and yet it was not the only theory in which one could have any amusement.
The second source of amusement is found in the situation of men in our day. An age has come when men are no longer guided, guided by tradition, but guided, I repeat, guided by reason. The old morality has been, is, and ever will be overrated. It has proved more numerous and more enduring than any physical or natural barrier. It has been determined that man is born equal; that his destiny is allotted to him by his creator; that his destiny is boundless and inviolate; that he is endowed with an unitive love of right and of the common good; and that, although he possesses many of the intellectual and moral gifts of his kind, he is still unable to conjure within himself the will of a just and faithful arbiter, or to penetrate deeply into the mysteries of human nature.
All this I have tried to show by my labors, my words, and my example—all this I have attempted to impose upon you, my fellow men, by the labors of my life, my labors, my words, and my example. I have tried to prove that man was not meant to be alone, but that he is meant to share the earth with his fellows. I have tried to teach you that which you have not yet learned — that which you cannot yet feel — that which you can do nothing to alter—that which you can influence to a greater or less extent than your influence may allow me to be of assistance…
I have tried to teach you that which you have not yet learned — that which you cannot yet feel — that which you can do nothing to alter — that which you can influence to a greater or less extent than your influence may allow me to be of assistance…

The tax code is a mess. Millions of dollars of wasted economic activity is wasted on things that shouldn't be there. The federal government spends about four times as much on the military as it does on domestic programs. And it's taking money it should be spending on people, like education and roads, and infrastructure…
I don't know if I've said it before or I should. But, you know, I'm a fiscal conservative. But I'm a fiscal liberal now.
And the reason is, I'm not a huge fiscal conservative, you know, like you and I. I think we ought to be spending a lot more.
I'm a fiscal liberal, but I'm a fiscal conservative there are certain parts of the government where I'm willing to go for lumps.
…And, you know, I think we ought to balance the budget within five years.
That's the plan, actually.
But we've got to get there. And the only way…
The only way you're going to get there is if people start waking up to the fact that, you know, government's not the problem.
Government isn't going to solve all our 
   
 
your problems. I'm going to be 90 in a year so I can't.
But if you start waking up to that fact that government isn't the problem, if you start 
– and this is a big "if" but if you wake up one morning and your sister walks in and says, Uncle Henry, I'm ready to 
put a bullet in your head, what difference will that make? Why would you have to worry about that? You know, we 
can all go our separate ways. We can all be making peace with death. We can all go our separate ways. 
There's nothing in all this that worries me.
That wouldn't be enough. You want me to stay with you. I can't sit here and say, You know, I don't want to live 
with you. I want to live with you. I want to make you happy.
You want to spend your lives with you. I can't live that way.
I want you to love me, Mom. I love you.
I'm not going anywhere.
I want a million kisses on your cheek and a hundred letters in my coat pocket and I'll go.

The power of reward and punishment is such that nothing is wanting to make us happy and contented, and nothing can ever deprive us of joy or distress. There is something in the thought of you—in the thought of us being together again—that carries such comfort as we never knew could befall us.
Let us hope that we are not far distant from that day when we shall have gathered together all the joys and sorrows of the world and we shall both be filled with joy and sorrow.
My Dear Worker:
My name is Sophy, and I have your favor to urge upon you. I have some things to say to direct your attention.
I have read your essay, and though for the most part I do not agree with it, yet I cannot help thinking that I may not be entirely free from some of its conclusions.
I think that men are naturally disposed to judge of one another by the standards set before them by reason; and this judgment, I apprehend, they tend most and leastingly to attribute to the less strong.
This tendency, I apprehend, produces in them certain fixed opinions, which they most readily attribute to the less strong; and this they most readily attribute also to the less strong, until they have made a great many such fixed opinions, and conclude as they conclude, that which they conclude is just and proper.
This tendency, this conviction, which they feel naturally and which they attribute to nature, they call reason; and this they call conscience, and the like.
This name, which they call conscience, which they call reason, which they call magic name, calls no thing at all the mortal creature.
This is the natural and proper place to place ourselves; upon that scale by which we ought to weigh the worth of the human person.
I cannot help feeling that, on this scale, we ought to place Sophy far below Eudoxia, and Machiavelli very near above Amida.
I cannot help feeling that, on this scale, we ought to place Machiavelli and Sophy both after death far below Apollo, and after death near after life after death after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after life after death after death after death after life after death after death after death after life after life after life after life after life after death after death after death

I'm not sure I should call this a review — I feel I have to, because your book is an enormous delight — but I think I will say something on the subject of the two daughters of a great friend, who are now about my age. They are of a different stock from I think every one of you — they are of a different stock entirely — a very different stock than I have ever known a man possess.
I was once with a man who had been a great deal like you — a great deal of your temperament, a great deal of your ways of thinking, a great deal of your customs. We sat side by side for some time — and then I asked him what it was that made you men and why do you love life so — — — And he told me.
We both felt that we were missing a great deal by living our lives in this world so side by side with each other. We both felt that the other didn't deserve the life that we took for granted. We both knew that life was passing us by.
We both felt that we ought not to linger on like this, that sooner or later we must soon get on with more important things in our lives. And we both knew that it would be so much the same to us both if we just got on with life to the end.
We both know now that we were lying to one another — that we really did love one another as surely as we could love — — and probably much more certainly than we could love — — — God willing — — — Elizabeth and that is why we never quite got round to telling the other we loved her.
We both know now that it was really the love that we took for granted — — that we really did feel that we didn't deserve — — that we really did feel that we really did ought not to feel — — and we both know, too, that we ought never to forget that we really do love one another as surely as we can love and that we really do really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really.

A man in his early fifties was rushed to a local hospital with what appeared to be a heart attack the day before Thanksgiving.
After being admitted to the hospital, the man's wife, who was with him, found that the man was not in fact dead. Instead, she found that the doctors had performed an operation that had not been planned or performed by the man's own surgeons.
The operation, which was carried out without the man's knowledge or consent, involved the removal of part of the man's gallbladder and the transfer of the remaining part of the gallbladder to the stomach.
I am 56 years old, and have never had a heart attack. I have been told that I should not suffer one for want of medicine, but I never took the medicine.
I have a wife who is as intelligent as I am, and has two young children. I have been told that if I would only take the medicine I could walk again.
I have tried everything, by every means at my command, but I have not been given the satisfaction that I should like — I have not been told that I am an unhappy man without a family.
I feel like a son or a brother or a man without a cause — like a prey to some fierce instinct — I am greatly alarmed and terribly sad.
I would like to know what is the matter with me; I would like to know what causes such despair — I am as sleepy as a child — as I read this letter, my eyes moist with tears, my voice low in the voice I used before, I am to every effort for a score of little things, which I hope will help me very much.
I will answer no one's call but my own and my own will, when my own is done, will go out a-world — and God be with you!
My dear one,
Have you not read this book? It is a book for girls. Girls love books more than boys. Girls read better, speak better, draw better.
Girls are crueler and braver than boys are — think of what they have done to us gentlemens!
Ain't no other, but standing up to cruel women, cruel men — that's the only sure way to be a true girl, isn't it?
My poor, pitiful, and pitiable little creature, think of all the good you may do — think of all the love you
====================
When I was in kindergarten, my teacher was a tall, lanky woman, with long, dark hair. Her voice was deep and clear, and she spoke to me with an air of real depth and understanding. There was no clatter of books or noise of study in the room. I had a woman in my dreams.
Long ago, in infancy, my dear Mother used to say to me, “Come, my little one, and play in the sunshine, and the clouds will hide: play in the sunshine, and I shall be glad that the day has come for my tramping in the grass.” And I would have said the same thing to you, my darling, “Come, little one, and let the sunshine take you.”
I have often thought that the reason why Mother used to say to me, “Come, little one, and play in the sunshine,” is because it is the way it is for us. And because it is the way it is for us, my darling, because we are strong enough, and because we love so, our Heavenly Father loving so, does He direct our lives, does He love so, does He look on so, we should walk in Thee's land.”
This is the thought which guides my daily life, concerns my thoughts, guides my love, and makes my deserts my assets.
It is a thought which makes me anxious; it is a worry; it is a prayer; it is a burden; and yet it is also a blessing, for it means that, though I lift my eyes to Thee, I cannot in the least bit miss Thee.
I thank Thee that I see Thee, that I thank Thee that I thank.


My beloved Caroline,
Do not be alarmed, my Angela, for I do not cast my pearls before anyone, least of all to myself. I have known a while now what it is to love with all our hearts, and with such love with such heart is to us both a kind of work, and it seems to us to demand our whole attention. I have also often longed to convey to you a wish, which, however, you will know is neither good nor advisable, for I can assure you I have no intention whatever of mounting to it.
I want, indeed, to be with you, and yet not to be at all; for I

We have all been there: you work hard and yet, once in a while, you just can't seem to get anything out of it.
I've put in a decent amount of time into this site, read all the emails, and yes, I have been doing a lot of following on Twitter.
But I think there could be a better way. Why don't we create a website where you can get all the news and notes from all the sites we run on?
Think about it. We could take every site we run on and create an account on Twitter for every one of them.
You could be the only one allowed to follow each site.
Think about it. We could do all this and we wouldn't have to pay any of your wages.
This is the sort of job no one else can do.

Here it is, folks. Just another day in The Big Book. 
Um…yes, you can read it. I mean, you can really see me typing it. I mean, you can even feel me thinking about it.
Just think about it. For the rest of your life, you're going to be like me. You're going to be like me all your life, and then one day you're going to be like me all your life.
Just think about it. That is how long you're going to be like me.

So, please, just think about it. Okay? Just think about it.
So here it is.

But don't worry. I'm not going to eat you right now. I'm going to give you a pill.

So you want to become a professional MMA fighter.

Or better yet, a UFC fighter.

That's what you'll hear in this article, if you take our word for it.

But you want more.

You want to be a professional fighter.

The goal is not easy.

It is not for everyone.

But if you keep pushing, one day you may become one of the best of all time!

You just might.

And you are not alone.

I know you are.

I know you are full of fire.

You are racing to the finish line.

You can feel it in your gut.

In your chest.

In your legs.

In your spirit.

You are pushing like mad…

…and you should be.

Because you are a true champion.

A true fighter.

A fighter who believes – fighters who take the fight to the people, not the system.

Because for you, my people, freedom is just a word – is just a concept –

– and you can be free – like me – like our beautiful people in Hawaii – like the islands of the South Pacific –

– and like us all – like us – forevermore – in the Hawaiian hearts – in the Hawaiian minds.

Because freedom means returning home. Freedom means giving back to your loving country. Freedom means giving thanks for

all that you have, all that you have got, all that you have ever will have – in the Hawaiian hearts.

Freedom means returning home. Freedom means giving thanks for Easter. Freedom means giving thanks for Mother's Day. Freedom.

Freedom. Freedom.

Freedom.

Freedom.

Yes, freedom.

Freedom.

I think the best thing to do for the country in my view would be to retire from public life entirely, to devote myself to my work and to my family, and to put an end to these long telephone conversations about my private life. —Henry David Thoreau

If you're not careful, you might fall into a routine that's broken you. You know the story. There was a time when you went to work every morning feeling a little uneasy. Maybe you tried your best to ignore it, but you couldn't help thinking: "There he is, just behind me. . . . I've got to run." No matter how much you tried, you just couldn't seem to get a little bit of way ahead of him. Or, even worse, you think to yourself: "I bet he sees me running! He knows I'm running! He must have seen me!" Then, out of the blue, you notice that your coat is a little dirty, and you try to change it for a new one. But he knows you're coming, and he knows it won't take much effort. . . .

So you just about give up trying to ignore him, don't you? . . .

Well, there you are — you and him, and then comes the inevitable. . . .

He's just about to make eye contact with you when you break. Your heart stops beating for a second, then you start laughing heartily. . . .
Well, that was that. After that routine of your, that was the fun. But there's another kind of routine I want you to be familiar with — a routine that will keep you from falling into those dangerous habits that only grow more numerous the closer you get to retirement.

The habit is known as the routine stare. It can happen to anyone. It can happen to anyone at any time. It can happen to anyone on any work place. It can happen to any of us. And yet, we take it for granted. Because it seems natural. Because we all do it.

It doesn't have to happen to you.

Because you're a human being.

And because it washes up.

The Government has announced that it will raise the national minimum wage to £10.20 by October 2016. You can read more about the policy here.
I have been following the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) vote to regulate internet service providers (ISPs) like utility companies for some time, and have consistently opposed the proposed regulation. In fact, I have been a strong critic of what I have called 'open internet' rules, although I have since come to embrace them as the price we have to pay for the open internet that we have.
I support the FCC's authority to regulate ISPs as utilities. I do not, however, support their authority to regulate the internet as a public utility.
I have long believed that the internet is not a utility and that to treat it thus would be to treat it as though it were a business.
I have long believed that the internet should not be regulated as a public utility.
I have long believed that internet service providers should be subject to the same consumer protections as other commercial enterprises.
I have long believed that internet service providers should not be subject to the same sort of rate regulation as other businesses.
These are my beliefs, and I support them.
I support them because I believe they are the right policy, not because I believe the Founding Fathers approved of them.
I support them because the internet is an important and growing part of our national life, not because the founders endorsed a form of regulation designed solely to serve a few
at the expense of all.
I support them because there is no greater triumph than toil and sacrifice than won from without, and toil and sacrifice come not from men who know how to work, but from men who are blind or dumb or both,
toilers unworthy of the American creed.

I am sure that every single one of you is overwhelmed with the tremendous amount of information that we as a culture have been fed for the last thousand years. It is mind-boggling.
I can see it in your faces. You are so astonished and touched by what we have been taught that you begin to cry.
I can hear it in your hearts. You are full of the sacred love that has been slowly building within you since you were a little girl. It is like a great, surging river surging against a rocky bank.
I can feel it in your eyes. You are filled with compassion. I have never met such tender compassion for any living creature.
I can feel it in your robes. You have touched me with a tender love that is beyond measure human.
I can feel it in your perfume. You have filled me with an aroma so fragrant that I can hardly endure here and there to breathe.
I cannot describe the beauty of it, can I?
It is as though the breath of one thousand stars rushed upon this Garden of Eden, and there they stayed, until, evincing their presence but slowly, they led with irresistible force into the West and became known as the banner-bearers of the Christ.
I have tried to show you that mighty force of mind and heart that has been steadily building within us, testing us, preparing us for a new birth, this new life.
I have tried to remind you that, like the stars, you have been slowly moving along, but that you, like the wind, are like as yet without the key to your destiny.
I have tried to remind you that, like the golden spires that surround the City, you have been slow moving up the mountain, but that, like the rushing stream, you become transfixed by the boundless bounty before you, and become lost in its vastness, beauty, andff eenness.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is willing to lift sanctions on Qatar if it steps up efforts to curb its support of radical Sunni Islamist groups, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday.

Iran's foreign minister says he hasn't had a call from his Saudi counterpart since they were in the race for the presidency in the streets anti Trump #Iran pic.twitter.com/q5sEIjYlZp6 — Reuters Top News (@Reuters) December 17, 2017

Saudi Arabia, which has opposed Tehran's nuclear program in principle, has frozen the assets of Qatari individuals and entities tied to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and the central bank has imposed tough capital controls.

Saudi Arabia accuses Qatar of supporting radical Islamist forces in the region and of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, a Saudi-defined political party.

Zarif told a news conference in Doha that "the two sides are discussing everything and will discuss it when the time comes".

Qatar has denied having any connections with banned Islamist group al Qaeda. It has signed up more than a hundred Arab nations to its $10 billion ($8.39 billion) regional climate fund.

Saudi Arabia accuses Qatar of being a supporter of groups such as Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which it says are backed by Iran.

Iran, a staunch ally of Riyadh and the regional power, says it has the right to defend itself, but has warned it could pull back from its Gulf partners.

It says the Saudi-led coalition is not attacking Islamic State but is instead targeting its military infrastructure including oil facilities.<|endoftext|>A massive (and welcome) gift to my art, I present to you, my Penelope!

It is water-resistant to 100 meters and a little sticky, but it is also scratch-resistant and will not tear or damage anything shiny.
The pen is made from 100% vegetable tanned leather that I have been using in my workshops for over 30 years.
It is a luxury product only available at my studio.
The leather is very soft and shiney and is finished with a thin, satin-like sheen.

And now a little exam to see if I have really learned the art of making lists. I hope I have not.
I shall not go into the science of naming, because I have read a good many English authors, and they are not to me those of whom I am equally ignorant.
I shall, however, mention a few names which have struck me as particularly interesting to my fancy. James Joyce is one. I found it in one of his tragedies. And there were a few lines there which struck me as particularly suggestive of the destiny which was to be the doom of the brilliant young man, who was to succeed to the throne of his native Clare, if only he would only care to consider the undertaking with the eye of a certain care. Of course, the fate of our species rests upon our young man's shoulder, and we shall not fail him, but we must not be distracted with the cares of this world by the cares of another. As for those lines in the Tragicas, which speak of him as this, that and the other; they are but the dream of a vain and foolish personage. I have read the novel, and I am convinced of the truth of the above statement.
Two days after I wrote that letter, my cousin, the pretty, the unfortunate Maria, who is my sister, and to whom I will always bear a faithful child, passed away. She was ninety-three years of age. I have no words to express how much my arms and legs filled with her sorrows and joys. I have never been so moved by grief or joy in my life. I could not sleep that night. I could not resume my accustomed pace that morning. I have been so occupied that my clerk has been compelled to sleep in my room. I have been lying in my study, my study, my passing days, my passing days, in the arms of that dear, incomparably beloved cousin whom I love more than life itself. I have been lying there, my secret lover, taking refuge in these words, because, as you know, Maria is unable to write.
I have been lying there, my secret lover, taking refuge in these words, because Maria is unable to live up to her duty as a sister, and mother, and wife.
I have been lying there, my secret lover, taking refuge in these words, because mother and sister love more than money, and education, and rights, and honor

I am currently working on an evening class on the history of mathematics at the University of Kansas. I am both a student of natural science and a graduate student interested in the history and development of mathematics.
I am thinking of doing a short study-group on the history of mathematics, perhaps on the history of geometry, on the history of optics, on the history of biology.
I know that in the course of my studies I shall come across books and articles which will interest you, and I shall take them in thanks for the interest they will occasion.
I am, my dear Friend,
an ardent student of history, and thus fully justified in keeping myself constantly informed of developments in the study of nature and culture.
But I am also led to inquire into the causes which have brought us to a point where we are able to say with some assurance that the history of man has been determined by the efforts of a small but intelligent race…
There can be little doubt but that the changes which have taken place in the climate of life since the disappearance of the elephant are the work of an intelligent agent.
In proportion as the intellect has increased in the land, the arts have improved; and more and more, the manners and customs of the people are revealed to our eyes through the medium of the arts and the tongue through the tongue.
The arts have spread to every part of the globe; the tongue has penetrated to every people; the manners have spread far and wide.
Be that as it may, let every one of us endeavor to live up to the standard set before us by our ancestors.
From them swam the stream of knowledge that led to our discovery of the universe and to the development of civilization.
From them we draw our inspiration, and apply ourselves to the training and improvement of our children.
From them also we draw strength and confidence, as we watch with longing the progress of civilization.
From them also we learn to cherish the best of all motives — the love of country — and to feel a deep and unquestioned desire to contribute to the general welfare.
From them also we learn to cherish a high regard for the truth — a reverence for reason — and to feel a strong desire to take part in the management of the affairs of the nation.
These are the seeds sown by our forefathers, and these are the flowers which will bear the sunless fields of tomorrow.

My name is Susanna. I love you. I am your treasure. All your problems will be my worries. You will not regret a moment of it.


And if it seems distant, remember that I was born this very night. And that I have lived all these fifty years in your arms.


I am yours; I will not let go; and with both my hands will cry out, 'Abba! Á! Abba! Á!'


In your letters you wrote that tender, intricate phrase, dear dearest, which expresses the deep affection that you feel for me. I cannot describe the tenderness of that phrase; I cannot describe the amount of pleasure that run through me every moment, when you write such beautiful words to me. Oh, that I could express myself in a thousand lines; that I could write to you, how happy I am in your arms!—Oh! it is enough!—I embrace you, embrace you heartily; I kiss your lips heartily;–I love you more than life, and love is not able to describe or describe well enough to all of you, the feelings it has just expressed, and the duties it imposes on itself.

I feel I owe you an account of my state of health; I hope it will last as long as yours; but, if it does not, perhaps you will pardon my writing so long, or else you will hear what a miserable case I am–believe me, I have the honour of having been in that degree of health for some years,–and yet I never cease to amaze you.

I have not been able to read or write a word, nor have I the least notion of going to any one's house, seeing if they amaze themselves to health, or if they please to petition me for leave to go to their houses and stay there, which I should happily oblige them to do.

I cannot bear the thought of my malady, which afflicts me almost continuously; it seems to me that I must either submit to it, or suffer the necessity of dying–that is all.

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a cartoon television series created and produced by Hasbro International, the Walt Disney Company, Hasbro Play (produced by Walt Disney Productions), and Lauren Faust. The show is generally regarded as one of the best animated television programs that has ever been produced, and has been for at least a decade now.

The show revolves around Rainbow Dash, a pony who is the daughter of Applejack and Fluttershy. She is the youngest of five children, the oldest of five, and the most intelligent pony in all of Equestria.

Rainbow Dash has the most wonderful sense of humor, and is capable of great generosity and compassion. She is also intelligent, strong, and of great beauty. Above all, Rainbow Dash is a good friend.

When she isn't traveling with her faithful companion, she is an avid reader and a devoted companion of the arts. Rainbow Dash has been described as being like a warm, kind, and loving mother to one little man, one little flower.

The show has been a huge and ever-growing fan-base in the United States, and has been dubbed by Time magazine as one of the ten best shows of all time.

In Europe, where it has been slightly less widely distributed, the reaction has been even more strongly favorable.

The series has been nominated for 27 Emmys and has been named a finalist for 14. It has also won the Audie Award, the highest public service award in animation.

The series has also been recognized with the M.F. A. and the Guggenheim Fellowship.

In all this, Rainbow Dash has been the voice of reason, justice, and the American way, while the accolades have been the applause of the hoof.

It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of this beloved friend, sister, and companion, Pinkie Pie.

Rainbow Dash was a dear friend, a strong advocate for mine as a young woman, a faithful companion since I could call on no more, and a wonderful example to me as I prepared to assume the mantle of Princess Celestia. She was the very definition of a loyal, devoted, and devoted sister.

My sweet one, I love you always,

====================
This blog post is part of a series exploring the history of smartphones, from the small MP3 player to Apple's iPhone and iPad lines.

The first smartphone came out in Japan in 1923, and it was called the "Broadway." Back then, the word "phone" meant either a book, a watch, a dial, a clock, or anything else that a person carried.

The Japanese wanted a phone that was small, fast, and simple to use. They also wanted one that was beautiful and practical.

This is what the first Japanese smartphone looked like back then:

Here's a shot of the back glass of my first Japanese smartphone, back in the day…

The back of the phone was made of a soft material called "matushin." The glass was set at an angle, so that only the front of the phone was exposed.

The lens was made of glass that had been refracting so much light that it looked as though it were reflecting the entire spectrum of the visible and infrared parts of the visible and infrared spectrum.

For the buttons, I took the shape of a soft flower, and made the inside of the mouth of the flower like an open mouth.

The power button was like the power button on a water buffalo.

The volume up and down buttons were like the power and volume up buttons on a horse.

The shutter and home buttons were like the shutter and home buttons on an airplane.

The windscreen was like a big screen television set.

I called the phone the "Broadway" because the colors of the seats were like the colors of the seats.

In the front, I made three little windows like the windows on a Broadway musical.

In the back, there were six little windows like the windows on a stage.

In the front, the stage was like the stage on which a Broadway musical was to be performed…

In the back, the stage was like a small small home that a Broadway musical was to be performed in…

Of all the things that have happened to me in my life, the most extraordinary of all has been the rapid development of my design sense. I have had a vivid idea of what a small, practical, and practical-looking handkerchief should look like, and I have concentrated my whole energy on it. There have been times when I have said to myself that

"We're going to have a big party in the fall for our anniversary. I asked my mom to prepare a buffet for us. She's the best ever. She made us a buffet with so many kinds of food, and desserts, and drinks, that it was incredible. We can't wait to go there."
– Sam, 21, self-help author.


"My heart is overflowing with joy and gratitude for the amazing people I've met through the power of humble spirit.
In just a few short days, I've realized that there's nothing I can't do for these amazing people…
And it's not just me. Everyone I meet is so kind and wonderful and kind. It's like being transported to another world… It's like being transported to
another planet."


–Pam, author of The Power of Positive Thinking.


"I've never felt more inspired, more accomplished, more in control, more in control of my life than I do right now.
I feel like I've just conquered something unbelievable. It's like winning the lottery. I've got an amazing
couple hundred thousand dollars, an airplane ticket, an assistant, an apartment, a car — everything.
I put it all into one place and it seems to work miracles.
I've got the answers to all your life's problems. I don't need anyone's help. When you ask me how I'm doing…
I just tell you that I'm so very much into the present moment…
Everything you do seems to be working just fine…I just love when things just click into place…
When everything just fits perfectly into place…I just feel so marvelous.
Everything just seems to be working out just how I want it to.
I don't need anybody's approval or anybody else's approval or anybody else's happiness or anybody else's happiness."


–Albert Einstein, General Theory


"We are surrounded by a rainbow of colors, but if we but look, with the human eye, the multitudinous hues which overwhelm the natural spectrum…
all would become night-black… The rainbow of colors is but the reflection in one of the many surfaces on which the mind and the senses are seated…


We are surrounded by a thousand scintillating beams of light, but we cannot see the thousand tiny rays by which the mind is pierced…


We are surrounded by a million

Everyone knows what a great love life a big family brings, but how do you find the time to be with your family?
I used to think of nothing but work, but now I have the greatest abundance of family~ I have four beautiful little sisters, and my dear older brother has three lovely little brothers~ 
…and there is no one like my Aunt Jemima. She is everything to me. The sweetest, clearest, healthiest person ever to live on this earth–she is proof that life begins at home and ends at 
home….
My dear Martha:
I cannot tell you how much I love you. You are twenty-two years old.  I was a poor boy, too, when I loved women too young.  But you are beautiful and intelligent, and yet you are not old enough to be lovers.  
Then again, I never liked to be a soldier.
When I wrote to you, I did not expect that over a period of years you would give me the love and confidence of a woman. I am sorry to say that on the third day 
after writing I have the strangest dreams….I cannot go to bed, only dreamily. 
Ah! Oh! Oh! Good God! What have I done? What have I said that they should hate me this instant? They do not at all, they only laugh at me.  
I am not proud, they say. I am not clever. They tell me to be. They also tell me to be. 
Good God! what have I said that they should love me? They love me for the same reason as they love all the young people on this earth – they 
love an chance to be themselves.
My darling girl, you are young enough to love. You can keep to yourself, you know. And yet you also know that if you kept to yourself all the 
more you would never love. You have already proved that you can. You have shown that it is possible to excel other people. You have shown that success is not everything. 
You have shown that there is more to human nature than sex.
You have shown that men are not born great but strong. 
Good God! what have I done? What have I said that they should fear me, that they should loathe me? They do not even loathe me. They only 
think I

Yes, I know it's late but I've just finished reading that wonderful book "The Portable Life" by Edwin Abbott. In it, he tells of how he once travelled the world by bicycle.
He describes how, as a young man, he was always enamoured with the bicycle.
When I was a boy, I used to read "Life on a Bicycle" by William Godwin to myself as a diversion.
The first time I cycled to work, I set my clock at seven in the afternoon.
I was over six feet tall and had a lean, muscular figure. I was also of solid German-Austrian stock.
I used to walk with such rapidity that I often made my heels crack under my weight.
I used to say to myself, "This will be my bicycle."
I was over six feet tall and had a lean, muscular figure.
I was also of solid German-Austrian stock.
I used to walk with such rapidity that I often made my heels crack under my weight.
I used to say to myself, "This will be my bicycle."
In his last letter to Margery, written three years ago, George Bernard Shaw says:
"Bicycle, bicycle, my bicycle, my bicycle."
—Henry James, "Madam," &c.


Have you ever been to the opera, you sentimental girl? Well, you see, I have — and I feel that I owe it to my creditors and to my family, too, to propose to my fiancée.
I will walk —– the opera will be over — I shall be revenged on all those who wronged me!
I will not chatter —– my fiancée will not overhear me —– and we shall both be rich!
And yet, all this — all this — this — this is nothing.
I know what life is made of, and I love what I live for more than anything in the world.
I have been away from home for three-quarters of my life, and yet I have not come back.
I have been a tenant — I have been an inhabitant.
I have worked — I have not worked because I have not earned my living.
This is what it is to be a real man.
I love you, Juliette, I love you — I cannot, cannot, I cannot, I cannot, I

====================
I have been wondering, since I last wrote, just how many hours I have spent in the same room with you, and what effect my movements have had. I wish I could tell you. Perhaps you will reply that I have scarcely been out of it a few minutes. Well, then, I wait for your answer. Perhaps you will reply that you have only been thinking about it. Perhaps you will tell me when you have a reasonable answer.
For the moment, then, I am content to leave you to speculate. I shall be glad to give you further hints in the morning.
With my heart I kiss your cheeks, O Paradise!
Love, the Love which Thine Ours Is to Love I Kissed 1872<|endoftext|>A few days ago, I came across a post that was pretty eye-opening for me. It's from a woman who shared her concern over what she called "the creeping demon of 'muscle envy'":
I read this morning about a study done by Dr. Arnold in the United States. 
It is a study in human energy. 
Dr. Arnold has measured the energy of 100 men and women in their thirties, for 
five minutes in front of a mirror. 
The results are stunning. 
One of his men said, "You have measured the energy of my entire being." 
I laughed out loud. "I think you are imagining it." 
The energy of the whole human being is greater than the energy of one minute in a public place. 
This is a scientific fact.
But a few weeks ago I came across another study which showed that the energy of the human being is greater than the 
day. This time I did not laugh, but I thought: "This is not quite as obvious as the other one." The energy of 
the whole human being is greater than the energy of one minute in the sunlight. This is a scientific fact. But a 
few weeks ago I came across another study which showed that the energy of the human being is greater than the energy of one minute in the 
sun. This time I did not laugh, but I thought: "This is not quite as obvious as the other one." The energy of the whole human being is 
greater than the energy of one minute in space. This is a fact. But a few weeks ago I came across another study which showed that the 
====================
Yucca Flats is the name given to the sandy plain on the Nevada border with Arizona. The name is also the name of the continent. The two names are closely related, but in this case the name is applied to the whole continent, and not to any portion of it. The land which we call California is but one part of the same vast and beautiful primordial plain.
The two names refer in the same breath to the same region of the globe, and the inhabitants of one are those of the other. The inhabitants of one name are as familiar with the manners and customs of the rest as with our own; and the same affection attaches them to the same pursuits.
The allegiance of one sex to the homage of the other, is a principle which has been observed in all ages, and will be observed in all.
The ancient philosophers were right in observing that men are naturally disposed to defer to those whom they regard as their cognizance and guide.

You're too cute for me 
You're too cute for me <|endoftext|>The Magical Mystery Tour is a book series by Australian author, illustrator and illustrator, Charlotte Perkins Gilman. It was published in 1967 and represents her most popular story collection. It is set in the year 2277 and follows a young woman named Hope, who moves to Earth in 2286 to hide out with her father. They have a son, but his name is Duncan and his life is spent as a scientist on Earth.
Hope and Duncan's life is a wonderful synthesis of love, adventure, adventure, and the opening pages of this book show us how the story ends. Hope is a brilliant young woman: tall, fair, full of energy. She loves flying, playing with rockets, and exploring space. Her father, a retired professor of physics, is a calm and patient man. They often spend our hours together, though there is always more to do. They spend the day together, too. They go to dinner together. In the evening they go their separate ways. And in between, they write each other glowing letters that burn like incandescence and move like shadows.
Hope is a bright and alert young woman. She knows that her beauty requires constant dressing and preparation, and that she must learn to yield to the irresistible impulse of nectar.
Hope is a beautiful young woman. She does not know it, but the eyes of two men, gazing on to the moon with equal passion, have moved the most enchanting of angels to express to her their ardent desire to kiss and to be kissed every inch of them.
Hope is a beautiful young woman. She is aware that the kisses that she gives to those eyes, which seem to sparkle with life and radiate an unquenchable fire, are also those that the God who gives life gives to her.
Hope is a beautiful young woman. She knows that the kisses that she gives to those eyes, which seem to radiate an overwhelming life, are also those that the God who gives life to her is giving her.

Here's a fun fact: In a roundabout way, each of the 24 tickets on your next flight to Cuba is like a piece of luggage that you'll never quite be able to get your head around.
I love you. I love you. 
You are so beautiful, you are so clever, you are so full of life.
You have no number on a piece of luggage, and my head spins around in circles.
Oh, you are so pretty, you are so wonderful, you are so wonderful—
You are the very image of a refined and beautiful woman.
You are my angel, my goddess, my favourite of my favourites.
You are the woman I was hoping to marry.
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever known.
You are the most beautiful woman on earth.
You are the most beautiful woman on the face of hell.
You are the most beautiful thing that has ever been born.
You are the most beautiful and wonderful and wonderful woman that I have ever known

You are the most beautiful and wonderful and wonderful woman that I wish I had been born in time to love.
You are the most beautiful and wonderful and wonderful woman that ever was and ever shall be my wife.
You are the most beautiful and wonderful and wonderful woman that ever lived.
You are the most beautiful and wonderful and wonderful woman that ever was and ever shall be my wife.

The following is the reply which the 1 st Lieu gure d'Allemand had addressed to me on the 2d of March: "My dear Depart menthe 1 st Lieu gure d'Allemand: —I must inform you that your letter of the 2d of March, in which you requested my presence at Passy on the following Sunday, was accom panied without my

I found the King within me, and lo, there he stands, my King, my self-sacrificial Son whom you at length found in you. You did not know it, Mother, but I had been devoting all my energies to your reformation. You did not know it, either, that the love which had animated your whole life had suddenly become profound and affectionate.
You did not know that, far from being exasperated at my aloofness, you looked forward with eager expectation to spending a few hours together, and even to a hearty supper together, with me.
You did not know that, far from being tormented by the idea of spending the night together, you are filled with a thousand images of pleasure, such as the eye can acquire who is refused the sublime.
You did not know that you would both be surprised and delighted to find each other, if only we will only work hard enough to yield to the irresistible force of the other's will.


I have been meaning to write to you a while, since we left Fontainebleau. I haven't had the energy to write to you much longer, since you have given me such assurance of safety that I feel I have no other recourse than to call on you.
I don't know much about your private life, but I know that you are a very private person.  I am also aware that you are rather unusually fond of your horse, Primrose.  I don't know why this is, but I can tell you this, that whatever happens between us, between me and Primrose, I will do everything in my power to make sure it doesn't happen during the next few months.
I know you are thinking all this over it, of course, when we shall both have forgotten everything, and that you will be thinking of nothing but me.  But think of me, you little shit!  Think of how pitiful I am to be the thing to whom you look up with such tears!
I am trying my very hardest not to lose sight of you, during those few miserable hours I have left you, but it is as though I could drive myself mad trying to recall you to myself.
I don't know what to say, you know what I am about to say?  All right!  You

====================
I've been meaning to write something about this book for a while now. I've been flipping through it with interest, and finally thought I'd share some of the things that stuck out to me.
The first is the title of the book. It says it all. It is called The Art of Charm, and the evidence is so overwhelming that even the scariest skeptic has to admit that she or he is almost certain to be helped….
You see, I'm a skeptic. I don't believe everything I read or hear. I don't believe everything that people say or do. I don't believe everything that—well, almost everything: I believe in myself, and I believe in myself a great deal.
But it's not enough to believe what I see and hear. I have to believe it. And the more I believe, the greater is the—the greater is the—greater is the burden I have in my life to prove to myself.
Because that's all there is to it. I believe. I believe big. I believe in myself, and I believe in myself a big deal.
Now, don't get me wrong. I still believe that you can have all you want and still get all the people you want, or that marriage is a fairy tale and the human race is doomed, or that you can have everything and nothing and still live in poverty.
Of course not. But most of the time, I don't believe most of the time. And that's what really counts.
And the reason is this: if I don't believe all the time, I can't bepist myself to it. If I try to convince myself of anything, it more than tears at my heart, more than tears me dry up.
And if I try to force anything upon the vein, it never quite fits, and I get so discouraged that I just give up.
And that's what this book is all about: giving me reasons why I shouldn't force myself to think of any of those things, and trying to cheer me up if I should stop to think of any of them.
The—the publicity thing? That's nothing compared to what this book will do in promoting my faith.
I mean, look at it! It's got all the big names all on it, and it says in big letters:
"BE PREPARED FOR A THOUSAND DIFFERENT LIFE
====================
On the evening of August 21, 1783, a party of soldiers under Major-General George Washington arrived at Fort George, Virginia, and stationed there until the following spring, when they were to resume their quarters in New York. The day before this party arrived they had ambushed the French at the Place de la Concorde.
The event had a great deal to do with Washington's determination to change the fortunes of Europe and America. At that moment Washington was engaged in a fierce struggle against the English army at Brest-Litovsk.
It was the day after that which Washington called "the day of reckoning"—that is to say, the 3rd of August—and it was the day on which Congress was to reconvene.
It was the appointed day for the re-assembling of Congress. It was the day on which to decide the case of Thomas Jefferson, the prisoner whom Washington had recently commuted to liberty.
It was also the day on which it was to be decided whether or not to permit the petition of Thomas Jefferson, the prisoner, to the said court, to which he appealed.
The decision of Congress, then, would enable Washington to resume his former station in life, to exert himself for the common good and the happiness of mankind, and it would also enable him to decide the case of Thomas Jefferson, the prisoner, and to direct his attention to the restoration of his former station in life.
Before I proceed to consider the case I must have a few words on the subject of Thomas Jefferson, the prisoner.
It is said that no man has ever been more hated or detested in this land than he is at the present moment. What is more incredible is that men should hate one another as they do, and yet the cause of hatred should be so strongly held in this enlightened age.
Thomas Jefferson, the unfortunate victim of passion, has become the object of enmity and detestation.
He has become a mere personification of the infinite inveterate malice of men. His crimes have been committed against an innocent people, and they have not a moment to spare to spare the murderer of an innocent person a just sentence.
It is said that no human being can bear the sight of him who loves him, and that, therefore, he cannot endear himself to her who is lovelier than the beloved.
This is a woman, indeed, to be envied. She knows what
====================
The latest evidence that one of the world's most popular sports and entertainment brands is struggling to adapt to social media has prompted a desperate gamble by the owner, Rupert Murdoch.

Today, he announced that he was selling the majority of his stake in the company, which accounts for around a third of his annual income of $18.5 billion.

On the face of it, the move looks like a brilliant one by Mr Murdoch, who has spent the past decade and a half buying up media outlets, charging exorbitant prices and then selling them.

His biggest success has been with papers and magazines — he bought News of the World in 2001 for $2.5 billion and has managed to turn the tabloids into the most read and respected paper in the land.

Last year he bought the gossip pages of the Sun and Daily Mirror, with the intention of turning them into the gossip pages of the country.

But success has turned out to be a stumbling block. It has proved difficult to persuade readers that they should expect the same from the tabloids, which have turned into a daily newspaper.

And even more frustratingly, their readers have not been persuaded that they should give them the time and money to do so.

So Mr Murdoch has been forced to turn to the Internet, where he finds an equally difficult time.

He has tried selling newspapers online, but these have proved too valuable a commodity for him to sell, and he has been forced to turn to the tabloids, where the price is much lower.

Now, with the price of a tabloid page currently sitting at $4.50, that leaves about a third of a daily Reader left on the balance to Mr Murdoch, the Times and the Guardian.

So, as the price of a page of the papers has fallen, so their readership has fallen too.

The result is that today the audience for the tabloids is about the same as it was three years ago, while for the Herald and Express the numbers are obviously the reverse.

So to make matters even worse, the cost of producing a page of column A in the Herald and one in that of column B is estimated to be in excess of $50,000.

If the owners of the papers are unable to pay this out of their own pockets, the only way they will be able to pay it is to sell a significant number of their outstanding shares.
====================
Yet the moral of the story is that no matter how great the reward, no matter how much the glory, we are not strong enough to do it.
We must strive harder and harder, even though our efforts are not in all points as great a blessing as they should be a burden.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.


I cannot write any longer. The fire of ambition consumes me, and my papers are almost wholly consumed with unfulfilled desires.
But first, a personal attack. My Lord and God is one and the same, and I bow down before His will and decree.
I have had a mind to keeping you, no, my darling, all my thoughts are framed around seeing if I can get you.
Have you any doubt as to my sincerity, or is it a sudden desire to woo you, which now puts me in a ridiculous frame of mind.
All will you kindly excuse if such an absurd resolution may seem to you absurd, and which, however, I will not enrage.
I cannot command, neither can you. If you will but excuse my temerity, and yield myself up to passionate love, I can at least put you in possession of this letter.
It will be an object of great moment, and of great moment only, I assure you, of my life and property.
The loss will be great, but the gain great. You will not ask for another reason why you must not have this tender and private possession of the most sacred object in the world.
I cannot promise you a page, a line, a smile, a peck on the cheek, or the most sacred secrecy.
Such things, however, are not as a prize in a sporting contest, where the winner is always the loser, and the loser always in the habit of showing his spirit and his valor,
in the arena of a battle in which both sides are worn down and weary, and in which the loser always seems to be proving himself still more sorely worn…

I just wanted to let you know that I'm back. There are no photos, but I have a lovely little place in the sky. I do this every year on the 30th. This year, I spent a wonderful morning,
and a dreadful afternoon, in a sort of eastern paradise. It is a kind of deep blue, with a sort of violet tint.
I don't know why this is, but this blue is disagreeably disturbing. Perhaps it is because of the unnatural light.
I did not want to be here, and yet, here I am.
I am back. I have been away. I have been a minute or two behind you, and now, in your train, I am at the back.
It is as though I had just come from outer space. 
You have been a minute or two behind me, and yet I have been at the front. Ah! 
I feel as though I were just going to the races. Ah! Ah! 
I am as high as Mount Everest. Ah! Ah! 
I feel as though I were as far as space and time. 
I feel as though I were as the creator of them all. 
Amen. 
To Ambrose Bierce 
To the Editor of Saturday Evening Post: 
I cannot refrain from quoting you in the hope of gratifying you. I am, however, in a hurry, as 
soon as I can. I shall be back in a few days, and shall have filled out my columns with as much originality, sarcasm, and wit 
as may be procurable. Your columns are the most interesting and productive I have had in some time. You have a great eye and a 
great heart. I am, therefore, deeply, deeply, gratified that your reputation, so infamously tainted, may be in a measure thawed. 
Best, B.

It's been a busy couple of weeks for me.
First I encountered the hexagram of Aiwass.
Then, as you may imagine, the water demon.
I think I'm going to choke on my own ramblings.
This is going to be a really hard week.
I was at the movies.
The Avengers.
Ivana.
The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Why do I write about movies all the time? Because I do.
Because movies are a place in which the soul is transported to a world of its own.
They are heaven.
So I, too, am transported to the golden plain of possibility.
I am led by the storm-clouds of possibility, by the rushing stream of possibility, by the silver tide of possibility, to the place where, far from all restraint, reason has lost its hold and where, instead of reason, there is the wild and unbridled genius of the angel.
And if I should never see the fountain of youth again, I can be sure that the great lake of possibility will never again swell with young heads.
I am quite certain that, should I linger in this town long enough, I shall again see that fountain.
I am certain of it. I am almost certain of it.
And if that be not too much to the credit of myself and of the town, I can never be quite sure of anything in this world.
And if to the credit of myself that I am leaving this happy place, to the peace of the world I send you a perfect sunset.
In due season my sunshine, shall you also be at hand.


My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.


My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.
My sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine.

The following is a guest post from Daniel P. Johnson.

Do you remember that day, a few weeks ago, when you turned twenty-one and found yourself in the unfortunate position of having to choose between two absolutely irreconcilable moral and intellectual loyalties? You were not yet a man your entire life had passed in the contemplation of one great moral imperative, and yet it seemed to you that you might as well hang yourself with one of your convictions as to the other you might as well submit to torture.

I know that in many of my former convictions I was irrational. Believe me, my dear girl, I have had many such. My first love was not religious, and the conviction of a second of that has been a heavy burden on me since then. I have looked upon death as the lowest of all possible hells, and though I would sooner die than submit to my inevitable fate of eternal pain and sorrow, yet I could not abandon my love of life without crushing my very souls to the earth.

You will sympathize with my grief, and you will understand my dilemma; for I can only speak the language of experience, and you can only interpret what I myself have seen and done.

It came naturally to me then, and it will come naturally to me again; as things are, I must either submit to the will of Providence, or to the will of no will but my own. I cannot but feel that, in this dilemma, I am supporting the soul of a dead body; that the will of my Creator is not as real as your own; that I am but a symbolic representation of the eternal law which you do pretend to observe; that the true law is, that men are made in the image of God, and tend not by the grace of their creator, but rather by that which is due to them from their ancestors; that the only way to avoid every absolute vice is to reject every absolute virtue; and that this final rejection consists in the duty of never remaining a slave to any virtue but your own, and never recognizing any absolute vice as true until you can clearly prove to yourself that it is the will of God that you should be slaves to it.

This is the only solution which will serve; and I shall soon be that second-born to you, the symbolic representation of the eternal will, the final arbiter of virtue and vice, the avenger of all the crimes of our species
====================
The United States is considering starting aerial bombing campaigns against Islamic State targets in Syria, a senior American official said on Thursday, after the jihadist group seized a string of towns and cities across Syria and Iraq.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private, said the United States was considering the use of U.S.-made F-15s, but was considering a much smaller number of older, cheaper aircraft.

The official said the US was also considering sending several hundred special forces troops to northern Syria to help the Kurdish peshmerga forces, who are battling to reverse the advance of Islamic State, and to train local fighters, some of whom could fight in the Syrian campaign.

In the United States, the official said, the Pentagon was considering sending hundreds of additional soldiers to Iraq, but that it was not clear how many troops would be needed.

"We are talking about a pre-position from the very top to the sort of people who are going to go and fight in Iraq, to train the local populations," the official said.

The Pentagon was also considering sending additional ground troops to Iraq, the official said.

The United States has been conducting a series of air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria since late September, and has been offering financial and other support to the Kurdish peshmerga in their fight to wrest back territory they lost to the jihadists in northern Iraq.

The official said the United States feared the advance of the Syrian Kurds, who are the US-backed local force in the fight against Islamic State, would mean they would be unable to assist the Syrian resistance.

Islamic State controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq and the group has been attempting to establish a "caliphate" there, or a state ruled by its own laws.

The United States views the Islamic State as an existential threat and has increased its military support to the Kurdish peshmerga, who are fighting alongside the Syrian army and American-led air strikes.

The official said the United States was also considering sending some of its special forces to northern Syria to help bolster local resistance to the Islamic State.

The United States has also deployed special operations forces to train local forces in the fight against Islamic State.<|endoftext|>For many years I have been a fan of the food truck scene. While there are a few greats like The Natural, El Pollo Loco, and Twinkies (I love

MaxFunDrive: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Apple Podcasts Google Play Music podcast

This podcast is brought to you by the amazing Audible for life. I have used their products for years, and many of you are probably thinking, "So what if I can't read a book, I still want to get into the gourmet audio world and I love the KDP." Well, I got around to it, and I've got a couple of bookshelves full of audio-book stuff … so if you're like me, and you love nothing more than opening a paperback and hearing those pages whir by in your head, I got something for that.

If you want to get into the gourmet audio world, you've come to the right place. I've got a couple of books that I recommend, like the one by the great Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Then there's this one by the great Fyodor Bykovsky. I used to have it with me all the time, so I know his stories. And then there's this one, the nonfiction one by the lovely and talented Julia Kristeva.

If you want to get into the gourmet audio world, you've come to the right place.

I've got the first three books by Josh Jones, all about the same time, about the same place, about the same people, and I just got through the fourth. When you're a guy like me, who's always been into as many different kinds of books as possible, and in love with the same kind of books, it just so happens that the kind that I'm into all of a sudden become particularly good at are the kind where the heroine just kind of *flips out* and becomes this whole other, interesting person.

So, my, my. That is one of the most compelling — and most thoroughly satisfying — bedfairs in all of romance.

After the failed coup d'etat against Tayyip Erdogan in July, the AKP leader has been on a tear of personality attacks and threats against the president. The AKP leader has been saying that he will try to put an end to the life of the president by all means, but there is no other way. This is a man who did not hesitate to kill his own father in front of his eyes. This is a man who has threatened to kill his own mother in front of her eyes.
I can only say to the president: go ahead, die. But if you want to live, become a woman and bear a son. This is what the constitution demands.
The constitution also states that when a man becomes the president of a country, he takes from the women and children and gives to the men. If the president of Turkey does not follow this law, then the law demands that he do so.
The president of Turkey must immediately fulfill his constitutional duties. This includes fulfilling his promise not to fire the prime minister, Davutoglu. This office has been vacant since the death of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in July.
The president of Turkey must also immediately uphold the law and order in Turkey.
The president of Turkey must also immediately fulfill his constitutional duties, fulfill his pledge to the people and fulfill his promise to Europe.
This is not a matter for professionals to decide. These are the basic duties of a president. The constitution provides for elections, but no person is above the law.
This is a matter for the people of Turkey to decide and the people to rule.
If we do not have a president who upholds the law, disregards the will of the people and abides by the law, we as a people are living in a police state.
You have said that you do not intend to resign your premiership. I can only say that this is a personal matter between myself and the president.
I am going to my home town of Akdakoy in the western Yenisey district of Turkey. I am leaving on the 14th to resume my duties.
I am going to treat you with the utmost respect and I guarantee you this.
I am going to my constituency office full of the pride and joy of a woman who has just had her period.
I shall write you a long and affectionate letter full of all kinds of happy memories. I shall tell you how very much

I'm part of a small but growing chorus of people in the US who are deeply concerned about the impact of fake news on our democracy. We've all heard the news about the election results in the US. We have all felt the effects of fake news stories on social media.

We've all read the stories of our friends and family members who, because of the false and hurtful stories, have been left feeling isolated, alone and angry.

We've all been amazed that news of this kind, of the kind of stuff that has been shared on social media, is even possible.

But first, let me say a few words about what, exactly, I think are the most important challenges and opportunities of our time.

I'm an optimist. I believe that when the dawn breaks on a new day, all those who waited patiently for it will rise high and shine, inspiring confidence in ourselves, each other and all those who seek a better tomorrow.

The following are just a few of the many things that have motivated me for years to do everything I could to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to live their lives, love who they want and work for what they are proudest of.

1) We should celebrate the life we lead, not the one we were born to lead.

There is something deeply satisfying in putting in action the things that create meaning and meaningfulness. This is why I am encouraged to see how our political and social systems are increasingly refusing to provide these experiences for our children and grandchildren.

The promise of the new millennium is that we will all enjoy the bounty of life, free to choose the activities and pursue the passions that will define us – and that we will live out the great American dream of full citizenship, opportunity and achievement.

But the real meaning of that dawning of a brighter tomorrow lies in the work of the many who have come before us – in the millions of people around the world who today are shaping the course of history, but who will shape the course of human history in their own hands in a generation or

The blindfold is a colorful accessory that can give the impression of perfection, but it is only the beginning. No, the blindfold is not the end of the blindfold. Rather do I look forward to the day when I can take it off and wear it no more.
Day after day passes and the nights chill with death. A breeze that blows from the north blows chill in the hair on the cheek. A cold wind blows on the grain of the wheat. A rosy day brings long nights of labor and hardship…
At last, weary from our labors, we stretch out our hands in grateful supplication. A soft breeze wafts our petitions away. A parting smile grasps at the corners of our mouths.
Then, long before midnight comes, a soft breeze sweeps us from our labors and carries us home.
From field to field, from hut to hut, we plant our seeds. From field to field, from hut to hut, we plant our seeds.

From field to field, from laborer to laborer, we plant our seeds. From field to field, from laborer to laborer, we plant our seeds.

When you see my account, you will see I am rather a poor woman than the rich woman I should be were it not for my riches. But there is another reason for the less flattering description. My imagination is much the poorer for the several thousands of dollars that have been contributed to it.
Your kindness and consideration cannot be imagined; but we are all descended from Adam and Eve… My father was a Hebrew, and my mother a Greek…
My name is Josephine; I was born in the city of Aix… and am writing you from my own hand…
My darling, my loneliest, my loneliest slave…
…is it not with a pale, and a heavy heart, that I must bow before you, and swear an oath, that nothing I say, nothing what I do, shall be taken in vain?…
…and last of all, I, too, swear an oath, that nothing whatsoever, however slight, however trifling, however trifling a part I may play in your coronation, shall prevent me from remaining behind, always ready to lend a sympathetic ear and shoulder, to any moment of apparent weakness.
It is with a heavy heart, too, that I cann't in all sincerity swear an oath, that, whatever your high expectations may be, my part will be to the credit of the people. No; they will remember me, and remember them very highly.
You have every right to be proud of Aix, and to feel a deep-rooted desire to emulate her example. But there is another city, and on that day you will know it by, another cause for pride, and another duty to perform.
For the present, however, let us hail the day as it is near, when the clanking of the encircling tempest will die down, and the fresh breezes will roll on through the still, calm summer night. Then we can retire to our rooms, close our eyes, and sleep well.
Good night.

The land of Rohan is a lovely land. It is also a place where the wicked walk.
 In my day, Lord of the Rings, New Moon of 1984, the gear I looked for in a bicycle was the same gear I got.
 I wanted a bike that was a pleasure to ride, one that was comfortable, one that was fast. But I got neither of the two.
Like the hobbit in the wood, I looked for his home away from home,
And lo, at last, I found it, and the home I was looking for is in the very place, the very place where I looked most not to…
…to find, but to hide, where there is no home to be found, and where there is no place to run to…
Wherever there is a tree to be found to sit on, and where to lie down, and a soft breeze to keep warm, and a hat to keep cold…
…I have been to Moria, and I will be back again, in the spirit and in the mail Baggage Claimer, on whose mast I shall ride, bearing back to my people my luggage stowed away for safekeeping…
…And when I have searched all Faramir's hoard for the little black Book of the and hidden gems to rule my life in, he shall have bewrayed me in my most intimate hour, when, hidden in his palace, I sought…
All this I have yet to do, and all this will be done, when I have got under the tree as well as the grasshopper.

Over the past few weeks, I have been working on a short story, which will be published in the spring issue of my journal, under the title, "The Nightingale and the Hare."
I am indebted to the late Lord Byron for many of my sympathies and for the energy with which I have devoted myself to the accomplishment of this object.
I have never liked to write, or to speak, to say, to do, to be with one'self—except in the case of Elizabeth, my beautiful muse.
She is the most beautiful and important person to me—and yet, alas, I have failed to please her.
I have tried to please her in many ways, both by my words and actions.
My excesses have been the objects of severe reproof, and I have tried to please her, if I could, by acts and omissions.
But my heart is still with her, and my hopes are high that we shall again see the celestial concert—
the series of pure and simple hours—the enchanting evening when, enthralled and entranced, we shall dance the delightful night dance—
that wondrous night when the leaves in the late summer wind will turn gold…
When the fragrant flowers of that fragrant garden will assume their wondrous form…
When, in that enchanting evening, the crystal chandelier in her library glass will glimmer with the brilliant radiance of precious stones…
When, in that enchanting evening, the sweet voice of Carmen will sound in my ear like the ocean waves…
When, in that enchanting evening, the gentle melody of Beethoven's Fifth will echo through all the land…
When, in that enchanting evening, the gentle rhythm of Beethoven's Fifth will sweep the land in a gentle breeze…
When, in that enchanting evening, the soft breath of satisfied longing will warm my throbbing bone and soften my ache….
When, in that enchanting evening, the soft breeze of satisfied longing will warm my throbbing bone and soften my ache….
When, in that enchanting evening, the soft breeze of satisfied longing will warm my throbbing bone and soften my ache….
When, in that enchanting evening, the soft breeze of satisfied longing will warm my throbbing bone and soften my ache….
When, in that enchanting evening, the soft breeze of satisfied longing will
====================
The problem is that if you live in a democracy – and we live in a democracy – you are constantly confronted with the temptation to exaggerate, to exaggerate. And you know that politicians are always tempted to exaggerate. Because if the electorate were really informed they would reject them and they would go on being for them. They are always for them. You cannot analyse them and believe them and despise them – you have to live with them and you see.
But when politicians are speaking the truth they are giving voice to a great many fears which the electorate has longed to hear. The electorate has longed to know that it is protected from the excesses of government and that it is not a mere airy category which it likes and dislikes. It is a real, living, breathing people who choose the representatives of the Government. They want answers which do not remain in the cabinets of past ages, but spring up out of the bosoms of their children. They want practical solutions to pressing problems, not abstract metaphysical positions.
They want not a dream of magical centralisation, but the immediate administration of affairs, a return to the simple administration of things which has proved so successful in so many democratic governments.
They want not to live in neat hierarchies of authority, but to live among the people; they want not to be MPs, but to stand on the shoulders of the People; and, above all, they want to live in this world as they see it, not as their rulers have written it down,
I want you to live up to these hopes, and if you fail to do so, to remember that your failure will be due to your own maladministration, not to the character of the people who elected you.
I want you to remember that your failure will be due largely to your own want of faith in us, and to the want of confidence in our Government which has arisen out of our failure to believe in ourselves.

My darling child,
I was with you in that dream last night, and in that dream I have always believed. I have known dreams, and been led to dreams, and sometimes to be led to dreams, because there I could see the way.
I was with you in the little boat which I saw rise from the calm blue sea; I was with you when the wind blew the torches of hope over burning shores; and I will be with you, I will be with you, when

I recently had the pleasure of attending the fourteenth annual International Open Source Conference in Seattle, Washington. This year's theme was "Open Source and the Future of Software": what should one expect from the conference on the Internet, where the speed of change is the dominant theme?
I might have mentioned at the outset that I am a huge fan of open source software. To the best of my knowledge, there are no open source projects in Microsoft Office, no open source project in Microsoft Word, and no open source project in Mac OS X. However, I have had the great honor of attending several conferences where this same theme has been trotted out. In order to be totally fair to the participants, I should have to say that I have not been able to attend the last two conferences.
Thus, I would like to present to your attention, from the viewpoint of the open source community, what I have seen and experienced, what I have read, and what I have heard, during the last year.
I must, however, ask you, the participants in this conference, to decline all recognition.
For there has never been a more pressing problem facing humanity, and the open source movement presents itself as the only hope of solving it.
What is open source? It is the open interchange of ideas, the free exchange of ideas among human beings. It is the free exchange of facts, the free exchange of information among human beings.
What has been the effect of this free exchange? All over the world, all religions, all races, have been raised to a higher pitch of consciousness, of hope, of life.
What has been the result of all this? Millions have been lifted out of poverty, and countless have stood forth as symbols of the wealth, the splendor, of the human spirit.
What has been the meaning of all this? The free interchange of ideas, the free exchange of ideas among human beings, promises for the future a peaceful transition from tribal life to collective life.
Within a generation, it may become a reality.
In view of these and other great benefits which the free exchange of ideas will bring to humanity, I, like everyone else, believe that the time has come for us all to join forces in promoting the open exchange of ideas among human beings, so that through the medium of these open channels men of science may gain a fair hearing and a fair reflection, and may act with a view to attaining a just estimate

As the Paralympic Games approach, the pressure is on the World Anti-Doping Agency to make some big changes.
I spoke with Jerome Pollard on Thursday, a few days before he went to prison for 22 years.
We spoke of Jean-Claude Van Damme, of the pleasures of the chase, and how one mustn't live and die by the sword.
And finally, I spoke of my plans for my life, and you were there – at the ready.
You have had to live with this story for 22 years, and I am 87.
I have seen the video. I have your face – your eyes, your voice.
You have had to live with this for 22 years.
My dear friend, do not force this upon me.
I am not guilty. I have done nothing.
All this you have done, you have seen.
Nothing was un-seen.
I have been privileged to enjoy all these years.
I have observed all these things.
If only you would permit me to go back to Rouen, I could again see all these sights.
You would again feel all these emotions.
You would again love all these women.
You would love them still – I will not abandon them – until I am able to do so.
I am yours, O Master, and yours only.
Dearest, most beloved Parr, 
July 9, 20 weeks pregnant. I have not seen my mother for some time. I have a great deal on my mind. My engagement to you is due in two weeks. I am going to Villejuif, and then to Maastricht. 
I shall not be back until the 19th. I shall see you only on that day. I shall not be in touch any more. I assure you of that. 
I am writing this in a fit of rage. I am throwing myself headlong after a man so blind that he does not know what is good and evil. 
I have suffered greatly at your hands. I have loved greatly at your hands. I have bled and died for you. I will never forget that until I am with 
you. I am writing this because I am certain I can call upon you no more. My word is as good as my bond. I entreat you with all my heart not to let my 
brain fall prey to that

I'm on my way to a shopping mall, so I can't be sure. 
Good luck! -J.K.
I just got off the telephone with John Deere. 
Good luck. 
Happy Easter! There's been a lot of it, and I'm just getting through to you. 
There were two of us in the plane, and we both heard the voice mumble,  "John Deere, 
John Deere, John Deere."  We both knew what it was.  It was like the one in the movie, when he says, 
"Now, John, here's your chicken. 
Now, John, here's your  chicken.  Where's your egg?"  The chicken doesn't answer.  It just sits there.
There you are, John, there you are.  Just a few more strides and I should be at 
Halifax, John. Just a few more phases and I'd be hanging on to this

little 
little

thing.
I've said it before, I'll say it again: the best advertisement is a good product. 
The best advertisement is a happy customer. 
One of the nicest advertisements you'll ever see.  That thing you just did for me, that 
was the best thing that has happened to me in a very, very, very small amount of time.
You are doing a great deal to make my life a little happier.  I'll keep you posted, 
I'll keep you updated, I'll keep you informed.  I'll never let you down.  John, John, keep me posted. 
I'll never let you down.

Just when I thought it couldn't get any weirder and I'd written this personal letter to my real 
self, and here it is in all its glory, in all its spookiness, staring back at me with its terrifying 
big, scary, scary eyes, it comes crashing down on me with such a crash!  It hits so hard in so many places that it 
cannot bounce back, it is too heavy, but I am carrying on anyway, and on Sunday I shall be flying to 
Hong Kong…and I shall be meeting up at your place

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the extraordinary story of how a young Israel Defense Forces soldier, Elie Wiesel, became one of the most beloved and well-known humanitarians of our time. Today, Elie is 87 years old and lives in a modest two-room apartment in Tel Aviv. But before he left for the US, he spent five years in hiding, fearing for his life. He fled to Switzerland, then Austria, finally to Israel, where he died in 1955.

Elie Wiesel was born on August 19, Prussia. He attended the Prussian Military Academy and served in the Prussian army in the First World War. Elie was wounded several times and finally sent to live with his aunt in the small town of Krefeld. There he read philosophy and wrote a couple of articles for the local paper. Then, in 1902, he decided to emigrate and, in collaboration with his friend Franciszek Pankowski, emigrated to the US.

Franciszek and Elie Wiesel would go on to form one of the most remarkable families in German literature, and their work, especially their novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, influenced generations of writers.

In 1902, the year of Elie's 18th birthday, the Nazis came to power in Prussia. In the years that followed, they ruthlessly persecuted Jews, persecuted and murdered their political opponents, persecuted the intelligentsia, and forcibly converted the country into one vast labor camp.

The Wiersals, like the Gestapo before them, fled to Switzerland. Elie, on the other hand, continued to read, and to lead a normal life, enjoying his hundreds of correspondence conversations and his countless hours of conversation group with friend.

The following year, 1905, came the storm. Elie Wiesel, who had remained largely immobile, began to wince. He glanced anxiously around the living-room, but could find nothing to comfort him. Finally, his mother, Dora, by whom he is very much dependent, concluded that he was suffering from something very serious.

He was taken for a psychiatrist, and in the course of his treatment discovered a book that he now adores.

In this delightful and deeply moving novel, written in the warm and personal style of one of his heroes, Hans Christian Andersen, the

~Peggy<|endoftext|>Like any great country, Sri Lanka owes its very existence to its people. In this article, we will consider some of the factors which have brought about this change.
 
The first and most important factor in our affairs is, firstly, an attachment to our home and family, which, if neglected, becomes painful and dangerous; and, secondly, a wish to live according to the precepts of our religion, and to exert ourselves in the discharge of our labours in the service of it.
It is a sentiment which has animated me from a young man's eyes, and from a tender affection which has ever since pressed upon my heart. I feel a burning affection for that dear friend, family, country; and the same tenderness for my country, which induced me to sacrifice all else, in her defence, in the cause of human happiness, more noble, more sacred, more sacred than myself.
I feel a peculiar affection for the memory of that glorious day, approaching, approaching, on which the drama of human history is to be built, which the destiny of man is to foretell, and upon which, under the dispensations of Providence, he is to depend for the support of his person and his property.
I feel a peculiar fondness, which has threatened to overtake me, in a moment, if I am not to change my residence and my occupation, to relinquish all in support of that day, and the work on which I have devoted my entire attention, my all, my energy, and my heart.
I beseech you, in the name of the eternal God, whose kingdom I claim, to send for me, my loved one, the young man, my beloved Nyamāyā, with the words, "Adieu, my Ny
====================
In the previous post I presented how you can measure the speed of light with a Scientific Method. In the next post I am going to show you how to calculate the speed of sound with the aid of the senses.
The former is a Science which has been the subject of a great deal of scientific and philosophical investigation; the latter, on the other hand, has received but little attention.
The former treats of phenomena in terms of simple laws; these are the laws by which the movements of bodies are measured. You may calculate the speed of a train by observing its course, you may measure a body's diameter by its cross section, you may determine its pressure by weighing its parts, or you may determine the temperature of water by considering its specific heat. All these you may do with respect to simple phenomena, you may not; for the mere consideration of phenomena evinces no relation whatever to the solution of problems.
The latter treats of the relations existing between phenomena, and treats of their solution. You solve problems in terms of these relations. You assume the form of a first-order Lawgiver, you assume the form of a principle, you assume the form of a law, you assume the form of some invisible, incomprehensible force.
You do not, therefore, treat of phenomena in the natural order, you treat in terms of your own particular conceptions of Nature.
In the same way you do not regard the solution of problems as an empirical skill necessary for your Science, but as a natural aptitude requisite for life, and you do not regard the solution of natural problems as an intellectual talent requisite for your Philosophy, but as a natural aptitude requisite for life.
Nor do you regard the solution of philosophical problems as a natural aptitude requisite for your Life, but as a intellectual talent requisite for your death.
In both of these respects you are unlike all previous ages.
Now, if we assume that the solution of natural problems is a natural aptitude, and that the solution of philosophical problems a mental talent, can we ever hope to a priori to a certain extent to deduce either their necessary connection or their probable negation?
For we may never be certain whether the former is entirely probable, or entirely inconceivable; and unless we are prepared to admit that their determination is entirely dependent upon our own unfitness for the performance of the duty, or upon the disposition of that which is to be, we shall never be able to determine the one from

The truth is, as soon as I've taken you for a real girl and tried to make you love me with all your heart and soul, I feel as though I had laid my heart on your thigh and was trying to push it in, but you hold on to me and never give up hope of being your real self.
You want me to feel ashamed of who I am, ashamed of my sexuality – and I think I deserve both!
I love you so much and I think I deserve to be so – I think we both do.
I want to love you with all of my heart – with all of our being.
I want to feel you against my soul and never let go.
I want to hold on to you, to be with you, to be free with you – to be your very all and never to ever be anything else.
I want to be the most that is humanly possible like the angels we worship; to put our trust in the great purpose that has for so long watched over us; to strive so hard to please you that our very very existence would seem an abdication of our divine inheritance; to cherish such a morbid hope of seeing all the beauties of nature shone through as you do in your books that we should almost certainly miss every glorious detail, and you will laugh heartily at us if you discover any.
I want to be just like the angels; to love with all my heart; to have all the fun of living like them; to be content with what we have; to bear all the ill luck and misfortune with equanimity, so long as we can so laugh at it.


I want to make you laugh. I am going to a theatre.
This is a scansion I have been wanting for almost two years.
I have been looking for something to cheer me up. I have wanted to write to you all this week.
I have been longing to tell you all this. I have been thinking of it so much that I have been afraid. I have been dreading telling you all this.
I have been afraid you would be sorry. I have been afraid you would think I had said something unbecoming.
I have been afraid of seeming unfaithful. I have been afraid you would not like me to tell you this.
I have been afraid of not being able to do the thing I wanted to do.

====================
I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just finished reading the book "The Atlantic Divorce Papers." The title suggests that this is a book about the Atlantic and the sea, but this is a book about the American state and the nation, and the Atlantic and the river. It is a book about the sea, and the land, and the people. I read it with a keen eye and a keen sense of their inner beauty. This is a book that has profoundly interested me.
You can find out what I am talking about by looking up the book's title.
I have read it a few times already. The first time I picked it up it was a little on the stubby side, but now I pick it up and feel that I should flip a coin on a hundred heads – and I have just done so. I will tell you what I think of the author if I could only get my hands on it. I think it is a wagner by the name of ———. He was a famous German poet and playwright. He was also a member of Parliament. He died in his sleep one night in 1720. His last words to his wife were —
O God, O God, when shall I meet you in my dreams, in my arms? when I feel at home with you? when shall I part company with those who loved and treasured me so?
If only I had a coin like that to prove it, I should be a great deal more than a wagner. I should prove that genuine wagners sometimes change their names – that genuine writers change their pen names – that genuine poets change their typewriters. But I don't have a penny for that purpose.
Now, my dear Luce, I am much indebted to you for the favor of this short but valuable article. I never should have hesitated to revert to the real wagner, the real poet, the real novelist. I have longed to meet one of you for many years. I have even gone so far as to publish your name in my diary. But I think it would only serve to drive you back into the past, and to make you even more determined than you already were to abandon the vain hope of meeting me in the real world.
I shall keep my word and publish your name in my diary, but I shall also keep my word and keep my appointment to meet no longer

John: You are in all probability referring to my mother, who was a very pretty, and quite remarkable personage. My father was a very similar character, indeed, both in manners and education. My mother was about fourteen years of age when we separated. My father was a large, strong, & ambitious man. She was a pretty, delicate, delicate, little creature. She was never more than twelve years of age when we parted. I cannot help thinking that if I were in her place, I should never have been able to bear children. My mother being of the Scotch stock, and having been born in Scotland, may have an Irish flavour to me. I have never forgotten that evening in Balmoral, when you and your mother and your sister & I supped out of your aunt’s favourite red satin

We've all been there. You're walking to the bus stop, and you see this strange man in a station wagon. You approach him, and he greets you warmly. "Hello, my dear," he says. "I'm so happy to hear from you. Have you been in any pain lately?" "No, not really." "Oh! That reminds me. Just now I heard that I had the greatest orgasm in the world! You see, it was unbelievable. It lasted all of five seconds and I was going crazy. It was like lightning. I don't know what it was. It must have been LSD. I just stood there dumbfounded. It must have been incredible. But anyway, I had an incredible orgasm and I needn't have gone through all that hassle again." "Well, I hope you weren't knocking about with a dangerous drug," you say. "I've only had sex once or twice, and that was on Valentine's Day last year. I don't know if that's anything unusual." "Well, I suppose it is," I say. "I've had about as many orgasms as you. But I think I've had more than you. I think we've both had them." "Well, that's quite true," you say. "But we just can't be sure. After all, you said you were just finishing up your A-levels. I know that you've got a degree in Chemistry or something like it under your belt, but you can only have had one a few months — maybe two. It doesn't seem fair to me. Is it really that bad?" "No, of course not," I tell you, "it must be quite normal for people with a scientific bent like us to have had hundreds of orgasms in our youth. And it must be normal for us to have had hundreds more in our lives. It must be part of who we are — natural — and part of the problem is to be understood. Because you tell me you've only had one, I thought I'd better tell you a bit more about me.

I used to be contented under the delusion that the increasing pressure of public opinion would tend to our mutual and marked relaxation. I am

are changing my mind — so please God! — sorry, but there is no going on any longer.

The Energy Department on Thursday released its annual list of America's 100 most valuable companies, ranking the biggest five among the nation's largest private employers.

Tesla Motors Inc. topped the list, worth $68.2 billion, followed by private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC at $67.7 billion, technology company Intel Corp. at $62.6 billion, and health care company UnitedHealth Group PLC at $61.4 billion.

The companies made the list based on total net assets, which includes stock and debt, plus cash and investments. Total assets are calculated by adding up total liabilities and total financial assets.

The 10 most valuable companies in the United States were:

1. Tesla Motors Inc.

Total net worth: $68.2 billion

Earnings per share: $0.01

Market capitalization: $66.3 billion

2. Apple Inc.

Total net worth: $67.7 billion

Earnings per share: $0.02

Market capitalization: $70.2 billion

3. Marriott International, Inc.

Total net worth: $67.5 billion

Earnings per share: $0.05

Market capitalization: $71.1 billion

4. General Electric Co.

Total net worth: $67.9 billion

Earnings per share: $0.06

Market capitalization: $74.0 billion

5. Oracle Corp.

Total net worth: $68.7 billion

Earnings per share: $0.07

Market capitalization: $73.6 billion

The Energy Department, the federal agency creating the list of the nation's most valuable companies, uses a different formula.

Instead of using net worth, the Energy Department uses a ratio of debt to net worth, based on the calculations of two of its five senior accounting officials.

The four other firms on the list, including Twitter Inc., are valued using the financial-results-based measure.

The Energy Department's measure, which is based on future earnings, is more in line with the industry average. The Energy Department's measure, which is based on future earnings, is more in line with the industry average.

The Energy Department is not the only federal agency to use a different standard. In addition to the Securities and Exchange Commission,

DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian court on Wednesday sentenced a lawyer to 20 years in prison and a former judge to 14 years in prison for supporting a jailed lawmaker, state media reported.

Iranian-born lawyer Abbas Boroujerdi (C) speaks during an interview with Reuters at his office in central Tehran, Iran October 7, 2015. REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi

The two judges were convicted on charges of threatening political opponents and were released on bail, a judge in the predominantly Shiite Islamic Republic's judiciary said.

There was no immediate comment from the two senior officials facing trial.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly rebuked the judiciary and was quoted by official media as saying the law of the land would be followed.

In 2013, a lower Iranian court convicted another lawyer of "spreading sedition" and sentenced him to 10 years in prison.<|endoftext|>In his first interview to British media since his death from brain cancer, British rocker Brian May spoke candidly about his struggles with depression, his love for music, and his new book, Feeling…

Brian May – "I've been thinking a lot about the last few days. I mean, I suppose you've noticed, of course, I haven't written anything for a while…"

You've been helping me out a lot, haven't you? – "I think so. I'm sure."

It's so nice of you. I feel so bare. – "You don't look like a woman who doesn't love someone."

That's the way it is in me – I suppose I must be – feeling isn't love.

You know, once or twice in my life you've really touched me. And the first time was when you sang "She's Leaving Me".

That was long time ago, and I don't know why, but that first little twinge in my chest – that was all there was.

But you, Brian, that is something new. Something that I've never before felt for one of my sex.

It is as if I had never known you, or thought I had never known you. You are like a third person to me – like a voice from another age.

You go like a storm in a teahouse – you are like a cold wind in a room – but you are not like

I am here to tell you that I love you more than you know.
I love you with an intensity that I can't explain. I just can't explain it. It's like a force within me that is unbreakable to the point of causing my blood to boil.
I am not exaggerating when I say that I feel as though I were about to throw myself headlong from this earth and into the arms of some giant, whose every motion could destroy me or at least slow me down.
But first, I must tell you a little secret, to prove to myself that I am really your lover, not in words, but in feeling.
Because I can no more hide the truth, I am compelled to put on the bravest self-denialism ever attempted by a human being. 
I say "bravely self-denialistic," as in the way in which I boldly proclaim myself to be anything but a simple shopkeeper.
Because, beloved ones, I know that this secret will bring great happiness on your part if, by means of it, you can blind me to the fact that I am just as much a part of you as your wife is to you and your family is to you, and that, although I love you dearly, I love even more deeply the one who loves me.
Because, beloved ones, if I am to live, and love and hold you as my own as one marries and marries a new life, then it is absolutely essential that I should have for a base motive in my life the love of my victim.
And so I have come up with the wildest idea—the most outrageous one, in fact—that you, my love, are secretly plotting against me.
You know, I was just coming out of the office, my window peering over your hedge, when you turned round and said—
"Why, there! Just outside! Just outside! It's you! It's you!"
"Oh, yes," I laughed, "I saw you there the other day."
That is all true—except that after I had gone, I saw you coming, and, swiping your fly with the tip of my pen, I caught the word "pen" there, too.
That is all true, too, though it is more or less trite—that sort of true—and that sort of trifling true which you tell your

Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Tuesday, calling the Texas senator a "major loser" in the presidential race.

During an interview with the New York Times editorial page, Cruz responded to Trump's claim that he is a "major loser" because of the way he has performed in the polls.

"Well, look, I think there's a lot of volume to this," Cruz said. "I think there's a lot of noise to this. I think there's a lot of people who don't like what I'm saying out there.

"But the truth of the matter is this: I beat Hillary Clinton in eleven of thirteen national polls. In all of them, not one has a margin of error of more than plus or minus five percentage points."

Trump responded that he had "nothing to lose" by responding to Cruz by name.

"I have a lot of respect for the fact that the people of New Hampshire, who are generally very conservative, endorsed me," Trump said. "I have a lot of respect for that.

"But look, if she were a man, I would take her, right? She's a woman. She has tremendous power. She would be a major loser, in terms of the race, if I were a woman."

"But you're a man!" Trump added. "Don't you want to be treated fairly?"

The billionaire then attempted to turn the tables on Cruz, calling him "very weak on women."

After initially cutting off Cruz's shot, Trump then went on to say that he would probably lose the general election to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

"I think I will probably lose," Trump said. "I think I will probably lose bigly. I will probably not win. I do not know.

"I will probably not win. I will probably not win at all. I will probably not be able to."

If you want the best of both worlds you should study finance since you can make very little money in it and still have plenty of time to study history.
~ Henry David Thoreau
I have been writing to you for two weeks, and still nothing has arrived. I hope you are busy reading this or that silly letter.
I shall try to reply to your letters as soon as I hear from you.
Since last Sunday I used every effort to avoid contact; this effort has been entirely in vain. Even when I did see you I used to type a few words and then throw them aside.
This repetition of the same useless phrases has been very injudicious to my cause. The more I think of it the more strongly I feel that you do not really want to know about us.
I shall keep you updated as to my state of health. Your letters of 22nd and 23rd of last week were absolutely meaningless to me. They concerned nothing but your physical well being.
I feel that they came from the brooding mind of some unfortunate victim of the physical fatigue which now seems to have overtaken you.
I shall keep you updated as to my progress. Your letters of 20th and 21st of last week were entirely delightful. I could talk to you now for an angel!
I shall keep you updated as to my own state of health. I shall write you a happy birthday once more, and you shall be happy to hear that I begin my third year of life. To think that, in the space of three months, I have become to you an immortal being!
I have been meaning to write to you all this week, but the little train which my illness has compelled me to abandon having run over a field of flowers, I called for in my fever almost daily.
I lay in bed last night, heart and brain filled with grief and secret anguish. In the course of the day my maids came and brought me a parcel full of cards, which I played with great pleasure…
One of the cards said: 'Adieu, sweet oldie…'.
…I have written to you a hundred times, and have not yet received a single answer. I am almost dead with despair. Will you, with all my heart,
send for Henry David Thoreau? He would cheer you up…
Since last Sunday I have been in a daze… and, oh, the horror of it! I
====================
I think I've finally seen the last of this hatchet job. You know what I'm talking about. My hat's come off already. I'm not wearing any more.
Look, here it is, just like that. Now here it is, like that.
Oh, look! It squeaks! Oh, God! it squeaks!
Oh, my goodness! I have just come out! I have just come out! Oh, God!
See? It squeaks noiselessly. Oh, there she is. Oh, that's my darling baby.
That's my pretty baby.
That is my pretty little Red.
That is my pretty little Red Davy.
That is my pretty little Red Davy.
That is my pretty little Red.


Oh, how I love a family, and how I long to have my darling Davy,
my little Red. Oh, how I long to have them all!
Oh, how I yearn for you!
Oh, I yearn so, I can hardlysto bed.
Give me my darling little Davy, I pray, my little Red.
God grant I may yet see thee upfield!
God grant I may yetstwartly tread the peanut butterscotch lane!
Oh, God, lend me speedily thy magic spurs of chariot and chariot wheel!
Speedily and with irresistible strength I pull!
Give speedily the lifeline of thy loving pity!
Speedily and irresistibly I push!
Give speedily thy loving pity a life of true freedom!
Give speedily the free passage of thy darling little Red!
Give speedily the eternal life of thy little Red!
O God, O God, speedily thou wilt do it!


Dear Doris,
I hope you are doing well. Your health has been such a source of great interest to me that, in spite of everything,
I cannot but send you this note.
—Oh, dear! Oh, dear!—dear Doris, dear Doris, this is a personal, personal note. I cannot tell you what to think, or how to feel, or
express myself. All I can do is say these are the thoughts in which I have been and am about to beili all night.
I have been much, much over you lately, Doris—d

The first thing I did after coming to New York City, was to go to the Magazine and see what was published there. I found a short story by Mr. Hirabayashi, and a few articles on architecture and art. I went again to the Times and found another short story by Hirabayashi, and a few articles on architecture and art.
You said in your letter to me that you had not been long in Neapolitana.
This is true; but I cannot tell you how much I love you there. The air is beautiful, the people are charming, and I feel so well adjusted in my new home that I cannot recall any other feeling so happy and healthy as I have now & then & always during my whole existence in Rome & in your love.
I shall keep you as long as humanly possible; but, if I owe my happiness to you, it will be for ever.


I will soon call on her, and we shall see how bad she looks under my minutely watch.


Dearest, most beloved heart,
You have been many times to me beloved, but most truly loved one this minute. You have been to me the sweetest sweet dreams of a little girl, have I! have I! and will I ever more? I cannot suppose wrongly, for you are as beautiful to me as ever to be.
My darling, what a change has been in me last night. You are smiling, and your coat is ruffled a little. Have I not been this morning in the Room of Requitals ?
In the mean time, M. de G onb has called, and is pressing so hard that, if he succeeds, I shall have to send for you by overnight train; but even that will not do, my dear soul, because even that may be more than one train.
I must ask you a favour, then, dear muse. Will you not lend me 15 sequins ? It is a very expensive dress, and you know that I only 4 months ago could not pay for it. I have already spent about 15 sequins on this piece, and perhaps a little more on the bauble. I cannot possibly in good faith repay you, in person, with the other half of that debt. I entreat you so to do.
I am almost mad about a favor, and you have only just gone off. Come back in the afternoon, and I

If you're like me, you're probably a massive Buffy fan. I've watched every episode, I've loved every movie, and when I think back on it all, I can't help but feel a surge of nostalgia.
When I was a little girl, I had my fair share of Scooby Doo, too. One of my favorite things about my childhood was my love of Scooby Doo.
Growing up, I had many Scooby Doo plays and stories. One of my all-time favorites was called "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." It was so much fun, and I loved doing it.
When I was a little girl, I would sneak out of my room and build me some "Scooby Doo" dolls.
When I was a little girl, I would sneak out of bed and go to the picture or the magazine or the book or whatever and I would read through that book or that magazine or that book or that story or that movie or that book or that toy until I was exhausted.
I want to be Scooby Doo. I want to be Scooby Doo.
When I was a little girl, I would sneak into the girls room and sneak a Mickey Mouse into Mickey Mouse.
When I was a little girl, I would sneak out of bed and sneak a Mickey Mouse into a car.
When I was a little girl, I would sneak out of the house and sneak a Mickey Mouse into the park.

As the first part of this series on our Top 20 Training Camps in League History draws to a close, it is time for our latest Camping Bible.
This time we're looking at our Top 10 Training Camps in League History and it's...
Well, I suppose I should start with my Top 10 in the history of the franchise.
The Rams were the best team in the NFL when I was their Coach. They were the best football team in the NFL then. They are the best football team in the NFL now.
And when I say they are the best football team in the NFL now, I don't mean just because I played for them. Because they were the best football team in the NFL at that time.
I don't mean just because I spent the last eight years with them.
I don't mean just because I was their coach for the season.
I mean they were the best football team in the NFL then, and I am the most,
believe it or not, 100% sure, sure, 100% certain football player ever to play for the Rams.
Yes, I said they were the best.
And I did not even know they were that good until I told them.
Because I knew what it was like to be that good.
Because I was that good.
Because I was born that way.
Because I dreamed that I was that way.
I can say with complete truth and without fear of contradiction that the greatest honor and privilege of my life has been the support, the friendship, the loyalty, the love, and the adoration I have received from my family, friends, and, above all, from my Hall of Fame-Coach, Stu Rapson.
I cannot tell you how many sleepless nights I have spent wondering what it is like to love a man as I do, and how much I owe him for all that I have ever known or ever can know in this world.
I cannot begin to tell you how many peaceful, sweet, and tender hours I have spent in his arms, and how much I long to lie with them again.
I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am for every thing you have done or will do for my education, for my happiness, or both.
I cannot begin to tell you how thankful I am for the privilege of living in the presence of a more perfect teacher, a man so holy, so good
